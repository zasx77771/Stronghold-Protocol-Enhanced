// audio URL rewriting for download managers (IDM / 迅雷 / FDM …) — see shared/media.js for the why.
//
// The game plays audio with fetch() + Web Audio (`audio.js`): it never uses <audio src>, <a download> or a
// navigation. Download managers do not care — their browser integration hooks XHR/fetch whose URL ends in a
// media extension and (usually above ~1 MB) pops up "下载文件信息" for every BGM track. That dialog has nothing
// to do with the game, but players see it and blame the game.
//
// So audio is fetched through a same-origin, extension-less path instead:
//
//     /assets/audio/bgm/act1.mp3   →   /media/bgm/act1
//
// `server/http/media.js` resolves /media/… back to the real file under public/assets/audio and still answers with
// `Content-Type: audio/mpeg` + range support; Web Audio sniffs the container, so the URL is all the same to it.
// A host that does not implement /media/ keeps working: `audio.js` falls back to the original URL whenever the
// /media/ response is unusable (a 404, or a 200 that is not audio at all — some static hosts answer a missing
// path with the SPA's index.html).
