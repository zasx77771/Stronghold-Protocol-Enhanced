# META.md — match & meta engine (server/match)

Audience: **content authors** writing prep-side ("SERVER_*") effects in `server/sim/content/*.js → registerMeta(registry)`,
the **UI owner** consuming `m.public` / `m.private` / `m.result`, and anyone driving matches in tests or tools.
Normative contracts stay in DESIGN.md §6 and §8; this file documents the implementation and every assumption it makes.

## 1. Match flow

```
LOBBY → INFO_CHECK (co-op 25 s; solo and single-human matches untimed; all humans confirmed ⇒ next) → BAND_DRAFT → BATTLE_CHECK (3 s)
→ for r = 1..lastRound (+ hidden):
     ROUND_START (2 s)  income + pending coins, upgrade price −1 (r > 1, floor 0), temp NOT wiped (what overflowed after
                        the last prep's deadline — battle-result grants, a SETTLE merge's elite with no copy deployed,
                        returned equipment — is shown and usable in this prep, `PlayerState.tempDue`; reward offers
                        earned after the last prep — a SETTLE merge — are kept for this prep),
                        shop reroll (frozen slots kept in place, then unfrozen), the round's wave generated (preview),

     SETTLE (3 s)       LP, coins, layers (the views showed them since the end of COMBAT, §5), bounties, eliminations,

```

**Deploy field (user playtest #5 item 7).** From the ROUND_START of a boss round (最终攻势 / 隐秘核心) a player deploys on
its half of the boss field (`Match.deployFieldOf` → `'bossL'`, or `'bossR'` for the second player of a seat pair — the
same pairing as the fields, `bossWaves` / `Match.bossGroupOf`, planned in `startRound` BEFORE the players' round start
so R14 → R15 never re-checks a boss-half board against the normal field, and re-paired — with an immediate re-check —
when a teammate quits before the fight): `board.js buildDeployMap`
reads the stage tile (r − 7, c) / mirrored (r − 7, 20 − c) under every board tile (r, c) (official
ConvertChessPositionInfoToBossMap, player_map_ud_offset 7) and that half's devices under the player's overrides. Board
coordinates never change (g.move, the battle input). A change of the deploy field re-checks the board like a terrain
change (`PlayerState.deployMap` → `_evictIllegal`; the read-only checker `invariants.js` uses the pure
`Match.deployMapFor`); on the data's 11 stages everything legal on the normal board is legal on both boss halves (and
the two halves have the same classes), and the boss halves add act2 m01's fenced tiles (board (10–12, 8)), which stay
legal from R14 into R15. The client mirrors it
(`ui/gameLogic.js deployFieldOf` / `placementContext({ field })`); the bot plans on the same map.

| Timer (real s, × `opts.timerScale`) | Value |
|---|---|
| INFO_CHECK | `config.timers.infoCheck` 25 |
| band draft turn | `Match.BAND_TURN_SECONDS` 30 [ASSUMED] (= `timers.bandTurn`), the step's only countdown: `m.public.deadline` = the current turn's end, no step cap (`timers.bandDraft` 50 = the official whole step, informational) (co-op; solo / single human untimed) |
| BATTLE_CHECK | `battleCheck` 3 |
| 机变 first / other pickers | `spFirst` 30 / `spTurn` 16 (co-op; solo / single human untimed) |
| PREP | `modes[m].rounds[r].prepTime` (co-op; solo / single human untimed) |
| COMBAT / 联防 | `modes[m].rounds[r].combatTimeLimit` (= the level's `maxPlayTime`) real seconds = 2× that in game seconds |
| 最终攻势 / 隐秘核心 | no hard stop: countdown `rounds[r].levelMaxPlayTime` 120 real s; overtime drain from `bossOvertimeAfter` 150 real s, 1 team LP per real s (§3) |
| ROUND_START / after combat / SETTLE | 2 / 1.5 / 3 (presentation delays, `Match.DELAYS`) |
| bot action delay | 0.9 s (+0.35 s per seat) |

A match with a single human seat at the start (独立模拟, or a 同盟 room started alone / with AI teammates only:
`Match.loneHuman` → `Match.soloUntimed`, user playtest #4 item 3) times nothing outside its battles: no INFO_CHECK /
band draft / 机变 / PREP deadline, and BATTLE_CHECK / ROUND_START / SETTLE run silently (deadline 0); the co-op rules
(draft order and skip, 6 机变 cards, 联防) stay.
`m.public.deadline` is the absolute end of the current timer (ms epoch, 0 = untimed; combat: estimated end at 2×;
最终攻势 / 隐秘核心: the boss level's `levelMaxPlayTime` countdown, 120 real s — the battle goes on past it — with
`m.public.overtimeAt` = when the overtime drain starts, 150 real s; both on the field clock).

### 1.1 Band draft
Co-op: random order (all seats, bots included), one pick per turn, ONE countdown: `BAND_TURN_SECONDS` 30 s per turn,
published as `m.public.deadline` (= `draft.turnDeadline`; `draft.turnSeconds` its length) — no step cap; AI seats pick
at once. A turn that runs out takes the strategy the player highlights in the draft screen (`g.bandFocus {bandId?}`,
`Match.timeoutBand`) while it is allowed and no teammate holds it, else `bandDraft.timeoutBandId` 华法琳, else the first
free strategy by sortId (`defaultBand`; a departing seat gets `defaultBand` too). One skip per player (`g.bandSkip`: the
player moves to the end of the order; refused when nobody is left to pass to); a strategy a teammate already took is
refused (队友已选); band must list the mode type in `modeTypeList`. A single human (co-op with AI teammates only):
untimed. Solo: free pick, no timer, no skip. Starting LP = `bands[id].totalHp`.

### 1.2 机变 (SP draft)
Family = weighted pick from `choices.schedule[modeId].rounds[r].families`; cards: co-op 6 shared (each player takes 1,
random order, 30 s first / 16 s others, timeout ⇒ a random remaining card), solo 3; solo and single-human drafts are
untimed. The UI picks a card with two taps (select → 确认选择, DESIGN §18.2). A 驰援 tactic card
(`single_special_choice_gain_bond_chess`) is only offered while its bond still has chess in this match's pool
(`Match.bondInPool`; a bond whose every member is banned would grant nothing); more generally a 驰援 or 盟誓
(`global_special_choice_bond_addlayer`) card is offered only while one of its bonds is live (`Match.bondLive`: not in
the mode's static `inactiveBondIds` — 标准 has no 拉特兰 / 阿戈尔 / 卡西米尔 / 奥术 … — and with chess in the pool), so
玛恩纳的盟誓 / 莫斯提马的盟誓 / 卡西米尔驰援 never show up in 标准. Card generation and the
family defaults are documented in `choices.js` (bounty / supply / shop / tactic). 机密商店 cards are **free** (official
text "无需消耗资金"). 悬赏决策 offers only choices.json cards with `draft: true` (`choices.js draftBounty`, user playtest #6
item 4): the PRTS table 卫戍协议：盟约 下半/PRTS盟约记录 §机变阶段 "敌人轮选" — kill bounties for the next battle ("下场作战")
or the next two ("接下来两场作战"), 源石虫·特训, and the 7 multi-round cards ("之后 / 后续的每场作战"), but never 战术特训
(listed under "※以下悬赏任务仅由法术教鞭生成") nor the 鸭爵 / 高普尼克 / 流泪小子 / 圆仔 cards (commented out of the table) —
105 cards, drawn uniformly. Every bounty card carries the effect's official rich text `descRaw` (the battles in blue
"下场作战" / "两场作战"; the overlay and the effects column render it; the effects column also says "还剩 N 场作战").
**Multi-round cards last two battles** (`choices.js MULTI_ROUND_BOUNTY_BATTLES = 2`, `bountyBattles` / `bountyText`): the
user does not remember any multi-round bounty (playtest #6 answer, "我不记得有过多轮悬赏"), so until that is confirmed
otherwise every "之后 / 后续的每场作战" card — drafted, from 教鞭 or “神秘顾客” — lasts two battles exactly like the
"接下来两场作战" cards, and its card and effects text read "接下来两场作战" in the same blue (还剩 N 场作战).
`MULTI_ROUND_BOUNTY_BATTLES = null` restores the official red "每场" (every later battle; effects column
"之后的每场作战"). The 战术特训 cards are what the 教鞭 Art offers (§2.5).
A `choice:<effectId>` registry handler overrides the default application (§2.4).

### 1.3 Disconnects, AI takeover
* Disconnected human: the seat keeps playing its last lineup; drafts auto-resolve at their deadlines, prep auto-readies at
  the deadline (the temp pieces due at that prep sold/destroyed). Nothing is bought for them. A battle the human was authority of goes to the server
  (normal / 联防: re-simulated from t = 0) or, on a boss field, to the partner's replica (DESIGN §14). The session stays
  resumable for 10 min (net.js `reconnectWindowMs`); a **solo** run's for the official `constants.singleReconnectTime`
  (86 400 s = 24 h, lobby.js `soloResumeWindowMs`) — nothing in a solo run is timed, so it simply waits. `onReconnect`
  resends `m.public`, `m.private` and the `b.start` of the field the player is on / watching.
* `g.autoplay { on }` ("AI 托管"): the bot plays the seat (drafts, buying, placement, ready) until turned off.
* `onLeave` (quit / reconnect window expired): 中途退出 counts as elimination (research 00-INDEX §3, 01 §9, 06 §7 /
  §10.3): every copy the seat holds returns to the shared pool at once; the seat leaves the round loop and the Final
  Assault pairing (re-planned when it quits before the boss fight; the boss pool stays bloodPoint — it would shrink to
  × alive / 4 only with config `bossHpScale.aliveScaling`, off — the user chose the fixed pool, DESIGN §20.10); its
  running normal battle is force-ended; a pending band pick
  becomes the default band and a 机变 turn passes on. Status `left`, LP 0, rounds passed = the rounds it had survived.
  When no human is left at all the match ends immediately (`reason: 'abandoned'`); when only eliminated spectators are
  left it ends as `'eliminated'`.

### 1.3a Solo pause
`g.pause { on }` (`Match.setPause`, DESIGN §14 Solo pause): solo matches only (co-op → `WRONG_PHASE`), `on: true` only
while a battle runs (COMBAT / 最终攻势 / 隐秘核心 with a live field, not while the Final Assault is ending); `on: false`
always. While paused (`m.public.paused`) the field clocks, the authority deadlines / release timers, the boss clock
(overtime drain, silence watchdog) and the server pacers stand still; `_resume()` shifts `deadline`, `overtimeAt`, the
fields' `startAt` / `lastProgressAt` and the boss start by the paused time and re-arms the timers. A disconnect or
`onLeave` resumes; the battle phase ending clears it (`pausedMs` totals the paused time).

### 1.4 Watching fields
Client-side combat (the default, DESIGN §14 Spectating; `Match._watchClient`): `g.watch` answers with the field's
`b.start` (a display replica fast-forwarded to the field clock); an alive player may not watch another normal field
while its own normal battle runs (`WRONG_PHASE 'own battle running'`) nor the other pair's boss field (`BAD_TARGET 'other
group hidden'`); eliminated players watch anything. Whatever is watched, the viewer's bond strip shows the bonds of the
player on screen from that player's `m.public players[].bonds` (§5) plus the replica's live layers (DESIGN §20.15) — no
extra message. On a shared field (联防 / a pair's boss field) the client remembers the teammate picked with 前往查看
(the `g.watch` request still names the field) and frames that player's half; a viewer who does not fight on the field
never gets its own strip there. A detail card's bond chips — and the popup a chip opens — follow the unit's owner
(the popup carries the player it was opened for); a teammate's popup lists as members their operators in the battle on
screen (the runner's `ownerOps`, its field meta predating their deploy). A client-side 返回战场 without an own field to return to (a 联防 leaker, an eliminated
player) sends no `g.watch` (it would be refused with `BAD_TARGET 'no such field'`). A reload / reconnect while watching a
teammate's battle after the own one gets the watched field again (`_resendBattle`, `b.start watch: true`); the fresh
screen adopts it as the watched field once per battle (`battle/observe.js resumedWatch`: a living player's teammate
normal battle in COMBAT, first seen while watching nothing), so the observing pill, 返回战场 and the own row work again.
The rest of this section is the legacy server-run mode
(`SP_COMBAT=server`):
`g.watch { fieldId }`: any live field during COMBAT / 联防; while no battle field is up (PREP, drafts, SETTLE)
`'n:<pid>'` returns a one-shot board view — during a battle phase an `'n:<pid>'` id must name a live field
(`BAD_TARGET 'no such field'` otherwise, and the viewer keeps its stream). In the
最终攻势 / 隐秘核心 a player fighting in a boss field may only watch its own field ("两名参与者会处于同一个战场，但无法查看
另一组队友的战场情况" → `BAD_TARGET 'other group hidden'`); eliminated / departed players spectate any field.

### 1.5 AI player (bot.js)
Buys toward a full board first (the cap is 8 from R1; leftover funds are lost), then levels on a curve
(L2 ≈ R3, L3 ≈ R5, L4 ≈ R7, L5 ≈ R10, L6 ≈ R12 — the competent curve of docs/BALANCE.md; free levels always), then
spends the rest on merge progress, bond thresholds around a focus core bond (most owned members, ties → most copies
left in the shared pool), role needs (2 blockers, anti-air when the wave flies, ≤ 2 healers), 特质 that keep adding
layers (every prep / refresh — the layer engines) and items for free carriers; refreshes while a purchase stays
affordable; sells bench chess that neither make the lineup nor build toward something (a live pair, the focus bond,
an elite). The deployed set maximizes unit value + activated bond tiers (exact counting via `computeBonds`). Placement
uses the round's enemy preview: every route is traced over the own board (ground: the stage's device-aware ground
paths; flyers: through their checkpoints) and weighted by its enemies; an exposure model (time on each tile × DPS of
the units covering it, blocker hold time, anti-air only on flying routes) is maximized greedily (blockers, then
damage dealers, then healers). Boss rounds: the player's boss-field template (`Match.bossWaves`) is mapped onto the
own board (rows −7, the right player of a pair mirrored, only the routes that end on its half) and the leader counts
as 10 tough enemies with a 30 s dwell on its first tiles, so the damage dealers reach stationary leaders.
**Rehearsal:** with `opts.botRehearsal = N` (default 3) the bot simulates the N best
distinct layout variants once each with the real `Battle` (a rehearsal seed, no meta dispatch, board restored exactly)
and keeps the one with the fewest leaks; a candidate whose counted leaks already exceed the best finished one's stops
early. A candidate is a whole battle — ≈ 20–300 ms of CPU (late rounds, 4 bots: 0.2–1 s per bot prep, about twice the
CPU of the real battles), so it never runs in one go on a real server: `Match.scheduleBotPrep` runs `botPrepBegin`
(economy + the default layout on the board), then steps the rehearsal in slices of ≤ `opts.botSliceMs` (default 8 ms of
wall clock, checked every 4 ticks; one scheduler callback each, so other rooms' battles and every request keep
flowing), then `botPrepEnd` (the rehearsed layout when it won, temp, Ready). The prep ending first drops the job (the
default layout stays). Virtual time runs it in one go (same decisions). Tests default rehearsal to 0
(`test/match/harness.js`); `tools/matchrun.mjs --rehearsal N` sets it.

---

## 2. Effect registry (content API)

```js
// server/sim/content/bands.js
export function registerMeta(registry) {
  registry.band('band_cannot', {            // 坎诺特 利滚利: +1 fund at round start when ≥ 5 were carried over
    onPrepEnd(ctx) { ctx.setCounter('cannot:left', ctx.funds()); },
    onRoundStart(ctx) {
      const b = ctx.data.bands.band_cannot.params;                    // numbers from data, never hard-coded
      if (ctx.counter('cannot:left') >= (b.capital ?? 5)) ctx.addFunds(b.interest ?? 1, 'band');
    },
  });
}
```

### 2.1 Keys
One handler object per key; a later `register` of the same key **replaces** the earlier one (content registers after
the engine built-ins, so content always wins). Sugar: `registry.band(id, h)`, `.bond`, `.garrison`, `.item`,
`.choice`, `.effect`, `.global`. A bare function registers `{ run: fn }`.

| key | runs for | source (`ctx.source`) |
|---|---|---|
| `global:<name>` | every player, every hook | `{ kind:'global' }` |
| `band:<bandId>` | the band's owner | `{ kind:'band', bandId, band }` |
| `bond:<bondId>` | every player (active or not — check `ctx.bondActive`) | `{ kind:'bond', bondId, bond: {count,active,tier,layers} }` |
| `garrison:<effectKey>` | owners of chess whose garrison has that `effectKey`, on its eventType hook only (§2.3) | `{ kind:'garrison', piece, garrisonId, garrison, bb, bbStr, where }` |
| `item:<itemKey>` | items **equipped** on owned chess (every hook); the item itself for onEquip / onArt / onDestroy | `{ kind:'item', piece, holder, item }` |
| `effect:<id>` | EffectRefs in `ps.effects` whose `key` is this key | `{ kind:'effect', ref }` |
| `choice:<effectId>` | the picker (and teammates for team cards) when the card is applied | `{ kind:'choice', card }` |

`itemKey` = item id without `_a`/`_b` (`chess_item_1_03_e`); Arts have no suffix (`chess_item_6_02_m`).
Normal and golden share the key: read `ctx.gd.item(ctx.source.piece.id).params` (or `ev.item`) for the numbers.

### 2.2 Hooks and events
Every handler method is `(ctx, ev)`; `ev` is shared by all handlers of one dispatch and may be mutated where noted.

| hook | when | `ev` |
|---|---|---|
| `onIncome` | ROUND_START, before the income is credited | `{ round, income, pending }` — write `ev.income` / `ev.pending` (e.g. 老鲤 withholds R1–R2 income until R3) |
| `onRoundStart` | ROUND_START, after income / shop roll | `{ round }` |
| `onPrepStart` | PREP opens (after 机变) | `{ round }` |
| `onPrepEnd` | prep end, before funds are cleared | `{ round }` |
| `onGain` | a chess / item was acquired (buy, reward, grant, merge result) | `{ piece, kind:'chess'|'item', source }` |
| `onSold` | a chess was sold (after refund of copies) | `{ piece, gain }` — **write `ev.gain`** to change the funds paid |
| `onRefresh` | manual refresh | `{ slots, free, price }` (slots mutable, or use `ctx.setShopSlot`) |
| `onPrice` | every price query of a shop slot (views + buy) — must be **pure** | `{ slot, kind, id, price }` — write `ev.price` / `ctx.setPrice` / `ctx.modifyPrice` |
| `onBuy` | after a purchase | `{ piece, slot, price, kind }` (`piece` = owned result, elite after a merge) |
| `onMerge` | chess or item merge | `{ kind, piece, baseId|itemId, consumed:[uid], area? }` — a chess merge's `area` is where its elite went: 'board' (a consumed copy's tile) \| 'hand' \| 'temp' |
| `onLevelUp` | shop level up | `{ level, price }` |
| `onSpend` | a payment's action is complete (buy / refresh / levelUp / reward / effect) | `{ amount, reason, total }` (`total` = funds spent this match) |
| `onBattleStart` | a battle input is built (normal / unite / boss / hidden); also for the stats preview (`g.unitStats`, DESIGN §18.5) | `{ input: PlayerBattleInput, kind, round, spawns?, preview? }` — mutate/replace `ev.input`. With `ev.preview` true (no `ev.spawns`) a handler must NOT change match state or draw match rng: the preview only reads the input |
| `onBattleResult` | SETTLE (normal rounds) and after boss fields | `{ result, lpLoss, perfect, unite?|boss? }` |
| `onChoicePick` | a 机变 card was applied (the card's own `choice:` handler runs first, then every source observes) | `{ card, family, picker, forTeammate }` |
| `onEquip` | `g.equip` (item handler only) | `{ item, target, golden, consumed, keep, error }` — see §2.5 |
| `onArt` | `g.art` (item handler only) | `{ item, row, col, targets:[pieces], error, used }` |
| `onDestroy` | an item was destroyed (player / replaced) | `{ item, holder, reason }` |
| `onLayers` | bond layers were added (prep or battle gains) | `{ bondId, from, to, reason }` (milestones: 维多利亚 25, 远见 10, 奇迹 100 …); `to` ≤ 999 (`BOND_LAYER_CAP`) — a gain at the cap dispatches nothing, so the milestones stop with the count |

Dispatch order per player: `global` → `band` → `bond` (data order) → garrisons (board in deployment order, then hand)
→ equipped items → EffectRefs (insertion order). `onPrice` runs the priced chess's own 特质 first (购买价格为N sets the
price that 远见's discount and the strategies' caps then act on). Every call is isolated with try/catch (the error is
logged once and counted in `match.dispatcher.errors`); nested dispatches are capped at depth 6.

### 2.3 Garrisons (特质)
The dispatcher calls `handler[hook] ?? handler.run` only on the hook of the garrison's `eventType` (a handler may widen
that per garrison with `garrisonHooks(garrison) → hook[]`, e.g. "<进入休整期时><休整期结束时>"):

| eventType | hook | whose garrisons |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_GAIN` 获得时 | `onGain` | the gained piece — run **×2 while 投资人 is active, ×3 at ≥ 100 投资人 layers** |
| `SERVER_PREP_START` 进入休整期时 | `onRoundStart` | owned chess: board, and hand unless `bbStr.conditionkey === 'character_target_inboard'` |
| `SERVER_PREP_FIN` 休整期结束时 | `onPrepEnd` | same |
| `SERVER_REFRESH_SHOP` 刷新时 | `onRefresh` | same |
| `SERVER_CHESS_SOLD` 售出时 | `onSold` | the sold piece |
| `SERVER_PRICE` 购买价格 | `onPrice` (first) | the chess in the priced slot (`ctx.source.where === 'shop'`); SERVER_CHESS_PRICE `bb.price` is the discount off the tier price (至简 3 − 2 = 1, 红豆 2 − 1 = 1: both texts say 购买价格为1) |
| `IN_BATTLE` | — | battle side (server/sim/content/garrisons.js `install`) |

```js
// garrisons.js — "<获得时>获得等于当前调度中心等级的【炎】层数（无需激活盟约）"  (SERVER_ADD_BOND_METHOD, add_method shoplv)
registry.garrison('SERVER_ADD_BOND_METHOD', {
  run(ctx, ev) {
    const { bb, bbStr } = ctx.source;                                   // garrison blackboard
    let n = 0;
    if (bbStr.add_method === 'shoplv') n = ctx.shopLevel() * (bb.multi ?? 1);
    else if (bbStr.add_method === 'hand_count') n = ctx.hand().filter((p) => p && p.kind === 'chess').length * (bb.multi ?? 1);
    const requireActive = ctx.source.garrison.desc.includes('已激活');
    ctx.addLayers(bbStr.bond, n, { requireActive });
  },
});
```

### 2.4 The handler context (`ctx`)
Reads: `playerId seat name round phase modeId difficulty isSolo isCoop data (frozen raw data) gd (GameData) rng`
(`rng()`, `rng.int(n)`, `rng.pick(a)`, `rng.chance(p)`, `rng.shuffle(a)` — the match's meta stream, never
`Math.random`), `funds() lp() alive() bandId() shopLevel() bond(id) bonds() bondActive(id) bondCount(id) layers(id)
board() hand() temp() piece(uid) pieceAt(row, col) pieceBonds(uid) garrisonsOf(uid) chessRecord(id) stats() roundStats()
shopSlots() effect(id)` (`piece(uid)` adds `area`, `holderUid`, `idx`; "身前一格" of (r, c) is (r, c + 1)),
counters `counter(k) setCounter(k, v) incCounter(k, n)` (player scope, persistent; prefix keys with your module).

Writes (all validated, never throw on bad input, never make funds / pools negative):

| helper | effect |

### 2.5 Items: consume-on-equip and Arts
Items whose data `kind` starts with `consume_on_equip` resolve through their `item:` handler's `onEquip` and are
destroyed (they never take a slot); set `ev.keep = true` to keep the item equipped instead (博士投影 normal), or
`ev.error = 'BAD_TARGET'` (+ `ev.detail`) to refuse. Without a registered handler the equip is refused
(`BAD_TARGET 'effect not available'`). Arts (`MAGIC`): `g.art` needs a handler; at most `maxArtsPerRound` (2) per round;
`ev.targets` are the pieces under the Art's `rangeGrid` at (row, col); set `ev.error` to refuse, `ev.used = false` to keep it.
Other equipment: 2 slots; a third replaces the equipped item the player picks in the replace dialog — `g.equip
{ itemUid, targetUid, replaceUid }` (research 09 §1.2 `UseEquipUp.unloadInstId`; absent ⇒ the oldest; a `replaceUid` not
equipped on the target ⇒ `BAD_TARGET`, nothing changes) — and the replaced item is destroyed. Equipped items are
otherwise locked (research 04 §2 / addendum: they leave the operator only on promotion, merge or sale): `g.destroy`
refuses them (`BAD_TARGET 'equipped items are locked'`). A second copy of an equipped normal item merges into the golden
item in the hand.

Built-ins (builtinMeta.js, overridable): 盟约之币 / 骑士储蓄罐 (random funds), 随身身份牌 (layers of the target's bonds),
紧急调度券 (take shop chess), 精打细算玩偶 (+funds each round), 简易通讯机 / 拟态物质 (same-bond chess), 见钱眼开玩偶
(+funds next round), 人事部文档 (cap 9), 博士投影 (elite now / at the next round start), 寻呼模块 / 信标 (pick-one
offers; 信标 gifts the original chess to the teammate with the most members of its bonds next round), 商业包装方案 (every
N sells → same-bond chess), 突变细胞 (after battle → random tier+1 chess), 画卷 (copy the operator in range with its
items), 教鞭 / “神秘顾客” (a random bounty is added).

**教鞭 / “神秘顾客” stay a random bounty (deliberate).** The official Arts open a personal 悬赏 choice
("选择一项（特殊）悬赏任务进行挑战", `choice_event hunter_band_1`). The server applies a random bounty instead: content
(server/sim/content/items/meta.js) draws 3 cards and takes one at random — 教鞭 from the 20 战术特训 cards (payout
`perfect`: extra enemies, the card's coins when the own phase is perfect; PRTS 下半 记录 §法术 教鞭 "于3个战术特训的悬赏
任务中选择一项", §机变阶段 "※以下悬赏任务仅由法术教鞭生成", 杜宾 加练！ "若自身战斗完美作战可获得资金"; user playtest #6
item 4 review), “神秘顾客” (granted by nothing in act2) from the band-bounty family `enemyeffect_b_*` [ASSUMED] — each
limited to enemies the mode can field (the built-in fallback: a random tier ≤ II bounty of `cards.bounty`), and adds it
with `ctx.addBounty`. A personal choice overlay would need its own phase / protocol message outside SP_DRAFT (a
second, simultaneous draft in co-op, with timers and AI takeover) for a rarely used Art, while the random pick keeps the
risk / reward the item is about. The
bounty then behaves like any other (next battles, 联防 payouts, Final Assault spawns). 神秘顾客's destroy clause (+1
fund, the Art passes to the next alive player) is content too (`onDestroy`).
EffectRefs: `effect:builtin_round_coin`, `effect:builtin_gift`, `effect:builtin_next_buy_golden_item` (整备),
`effect:builtin_next_buy_elite` (升华).

### 2.6 机变 card application
`choice:<effectId>` handler (content) → else the family default (choices.js): bounty → `ctx.addBounty`; supply/shop →
item to the hand; tactic by buff key (`global_special_choice_gain_equip`, `_bond_addlayer`, `_gain_coin`, `_refresh_free`,
`single_special_choice_gloden_equip_chess`, `_gloden_char_chess`, `_gain_bond_chess`, `auto_chess_change_map`); every
other buff becomes a battle EffectRef (`key: 'choice:<effectId>'`, `params` = effect params) for the sim content.
Team cards (`team: true`) apply to every alive teammate as well.

```js
// choices.js — override the 自愈 card: keep it as a battle effect but show a counter
registry.choice('allybuff_select_11', {
  onChoicePick(ctx, ev) {
    // the EffectRef below carries this same key, so this handler also runs (source kind 'effect') on every LATER
    // onChoicePick dispatch — apply the card only when it is the card being applied
    if (ctx.source.kind !== 'choice') return;
    ctx.addEffect({ id: `heal:${ctx.round}`, key: 'choice:allybuff_select_11', name: ev.card.name, desc: ev.card.desc,
                    iconKind: 'team', params: ctx.data.effects.allybuff_select_11.params });
  },
});
```
Any `choice:` handler whose EffectRef reuses its own key must guard like this (or give the EffectRef an `effect:` key).

## 3. Rules implemented (summary; details in each module header)

* **Economy**: income `config.economy.income[r]` (= min(3+r, 12)); bounty coins / pending funds credited at the next
  round start; leftover funds lost at prep end except `leftoverFundsKeptByBands`. Chess price by tier (2/3/3/3/4/4),
  items by `price`, refresh 1 (free refreshes first), sell +1 (elite too; items cannot be sold, only destroyed).
* **Shop**: `shopSlots[level]` chess slots + item slot(s), copy-weighted rolls over remaining pool copies of unbanned,
  visible chess with tier ≤ level; item slot: tier by the same shares, uniform item within the tier. Level-up price =
  base per mode, −1 each round start (floor 0), reset to the next base after upgrading; `MAX_LEVEL` at 6. One freeze
  toggle freezes every unsold slot until the next round start; a manual refresh rerolls everything (new slots stay
  frozen). Unfrozen slots are cleared at combat start. Slot positions are stable (frozen slots keep their index).
* **Pool**: copies 12/14/18/16/8/5 (缪尔赛思 4); a normal piece holds 1 copy, an elite 3; displays never reserve copies;
  selling, temp resolution and elimination return exactly what a piece holds (`left + held = cap` always).
* **Hand**: 10 slots filled right→left, 5 temp slots for passive overflow (merge results, grants, returned equipment);
  a full hand refuses buys unless the purchase completes a merge, and withdrawals unless the withdrawn summoner's own
  summon stack frees a slot (a deployed summon withdrawn with no stack of its own left to join is a new card: `HAND_FULL`,
  never temp); temp blocks Ready. A temp piece is resolved (chess sold back to the pool, items destroyed, a summon stack
  removed — it comes back at the next round start, see Summons) at the deadline of the first prep in which its player could act on it (`PlayerState.tempDue` vs
  `prepsEnded`, recorded by `_putTemp`, user playtest #3): arrived during a prep before Ready → that prep's end; after
  Ready, during onPrepEnd, or outside PREP (COMBAT, 联防, SETTLE, ROUND_START, 机变) → the end of the NEXT prep, so it
  is shown and usable first; `setReady(false)` makes what arrived while ready due at the current prep. The round
  start never wipes temp (DESIGN §6.2).
* **Merge**: 3 normal copies (风丸 2) anywhere (board/hand/temp) → 1 elite (the incoming copy, then temp, hand, board
  copies are consumed). Where it goes (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "发送1名【精锐】状态的该干员至手牌区（若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，
  则发送至作战区对应位置）", the user's playtest #6 follow-up): when a consumed copy stood on the board, onto that copy's
  tile with its facing — of several, the one that deploys first (row desc, then col asc; `board.js mergeTile`,
  [ASSUMED]); a deployed piece transformed into the completing copy (突变细胞, `transformChess`) counts with its own tile;
  a tile the elite may not use (a stale terrain change) is skipped. It replaces a deployed copy, so the deploy count never
  grows (no BOARD_FULL), and as a deployment its manually deployable summons join the hand (`grantTokensFor`, the
  player's loadout). Otherwise the elite goes to the hand, overflowing into temp. Equipment returns to the hand (overflow
  temp; with both full it stays on the elite, up to its 2 equip slots — any further item is destroyed); summons of
  consumed copies are removed; a reward offer of 3
  **different** free chess of tier min(level+1, 6) (copy-weighted from the shared pool, already-drawn ones excluded; a
  short tier tops up from the tier below — user playtest #6 item 19; pick 1, expires at prep end; queued when several
  merges happen). The same rule holds for every way a merge completes — buy, reward pick, effect / band / choice grants
  (`acquireChess`), transformations — and in every phase: a merge completed after the prep (SETTLE / Final Assault
  effects such as 突变细胞) keeps its offer for the next prep; its elite takes the deployed copy's tile at once, or goes to
  the hand / temp (kept through the next prep, see Hand). In a boss round's prep the tile is read on the player's half of
  the boss field (board coordinates unchanged). `onMerge` carries `area` ('board' | 'hand' | 'temp').
* **Board**: rows 9–12 × cols 2–10, legality from `stages[id].tiles` + devices (board.js); deploy cap 8 (+effects);
  summons don't use slots; board↔hand swaps always allowed. A terrain change (terrain 机变 cards such as 模拟战场演变·
  模式二 "阻隔工事变为射击台", content `setDeviceActive` / `setTileOverride`) is checked at the next `recompute()` (at the
  latest when the battle input is built): a piece left on a tile it may no longer occupy — a melee operator on a new
  射击台 — is withdrawn to the hand (overflow temp: re-placed during the prep; its summons leave with it), a summon back
  onto its stack, with a toast (`PlayerState._evictIllegal`).
* **Summons** (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §战斗部署, user playtest #6): an operator placed on the board sends its manually deployable
  summons (tokens.json `placeable`: 赫默 S2 医疗探机, 巫恋 S2 诅咒娃娃, 凯瑟琳 爬行号·防护单元, 浊心斯卡蒂 海嗣, 伺夜 狼群,
  缪尔赛思 流形 — only those its equipped skill / module makes, `gamedata.placeableTokens(chessId, loadout)`) to the hand as
  one stack of deploy-limit copies (凯瑟琳 2 of her 3 devices); each copy is placed and turned like any piece (no deploy
  slot — the PRTS token pages give 部署占用数 0), only while its owner is on the board. Withdrawing / selling / merging the
  owner removes its summons; moving it to another tile (a move, a swap, or a summon dragged onto it — that summon stays
  where it was dropped) sends its placed summons back onto their stack ("移动干员时，其所属召唤物全部退场并重置至手牌区";
  `PlayerState._liftTokensOf`). A stack that overflowed into temp and was removed at a prep deadline comes back at the
  next round start (§手牌区 "干员所属召唤物会于下一回合返还": `PlayerState.startRound` tops every board owner's summons up
  to the deploy limit, `grantTokensFor`). Battle side: SIM.md §1.1 token pieces.
* **Bonds**: bondsMeta.js (BOARD distinct, BOARD_AND_DECK, 绝技 elites, 调和 +1, 独行 downward, 助力 upper tiers,
  变形同构体 grants). Σ activated layers for the hidden core = Σ layers of active bonds at the boss round's prep end.
  **Layer cap** (research 11 §1; the client's `MAX_GARRISON_STACK` / `AddBondCount` = min(L + n, 999)): each bond's
  layers stop at `BOND_LAYER_CAP` = 999 (shared/constants.js; 0 / Infinity = off). Every writer clamps with
  `layerGainRoom` — `PlayerState.addLayers` (all prep-side gains: 特质, items, bands, 机变 cards, bonds; `ctx.addLayers`),
  the SETTLE of the in-battle gains and the battle's own live copy (`Battle.addLayers`, SIM.md §6); a gain at the cap
  adds 0 and dispatches no onLayers. The client-result check bounds a reported gain by the room left from the bond's
  starting layers (`fields.js validateClientResult`, 'layer bound'); `invariants.js` flags a bond above the cap. The
  bond strip, its popup, the effect text and the detail card show the server's capped count. The dev tools' direct
  writes (`tools/matchrun.mjs --layers N`, `tools/balance.mjs applyBoard`) stop at the cap too.
* **Waves**: waves.js header (stage/factions/boss per match, faction replacement per round with `k` copies, scaling by
  `enemyScale[r]` × the tuning layer §3.1, bounties, boss templates, 联防 routing). Bounties with battles left (every one
  that lasts more than one battle; an official multi-round card lasts two, §1.2) also spawn in the Final Assault /
  Hidden Core, on the owner's half of the boss field (a route ending at its goal); the boss battle then uses up one of
  the bounty's battles and its kill coins go to pending funds.
* **Combat time limit**: data `combatTimeLimit` (the level's `maxPlayTime`) counts REAL seconds of the forced 2×
  battle; the Battle / 联防 limit is `gd.combatTimeLimit(r)` = 2 × that in game seconds (`config.combatTimeScale`,
  default 2). Read as game seconds the rounds' own spawn schedules would not fit (R2's last flyer spawns at 43 s of
  45 s, R3's at 62 s of 55 s); × 2 every limit ≈ last spawn + one flyer crossing. docs/BALANCE.md §2.1.
* **SETTLE**: LP −min(counted leaks, 10) (after 联防: survivors attributed to their source, same cap); IN_BATTLE layer
  gains applied, each bond up to `BOND_LAYER_CAP` (999, `layerGainRoom`, as `PlayerState.addLayers`); kill-bounty coins (paid by the Battle to the killer — a 联防 helper included) and perfect-bounty coins
  (own phase perfect) go to pending funds; bounty rounds decrement; LP ≤ 0 ⇒ eliminated (all copies back to the pool).
* **Final Assault / Hidden Core**: finalAssault.js header. Boards are passed in board coordinates; the sim maps board
  rows 9–12 onto boss rows 2–5 (`BOSS_ROW_OFFSET` −7, matching every stage's boss rows) and mirrors the right side.
  Pool (`finalAssault.js bossPoolHp` → `GameData.bossPoolShare`, DESIGN §20.10): one pool shared by every boss field
  (official tip "最终攻势中，所有人将一起对敌方领袖造成伤害"); co-op = `bloodPoint[difficulty]` whatever the number of alive
  players (notice 5114's "敌方领袖的总生命值不变" is about the mirrored copies of a pair field sharing the pool, not about that
  number); `bossHpScale.aliveScaling` true (default false) would scale it × alive / `aliveFull` (4) — 巴哈姆特 12294
  "聯機隊友(撤退/死掉)變少，最後boss血條也會變少" is one community note without a proportion, kept off until the user confirms
  it (it would shorten the fight after eliminations, the opposite of the playtest report); solo = ×
  `bossHpScale.solo` (0.25 = one player of four [ASSUMED]); leaders are never scaled by `enemyScale`. The merged team LP loses leaks (`lpr`), the overtime drain
  (`bossTurnHpReduceTime` 150 counts REAL seconds, like the boss level's 120 s maxPlayTime that runs out first — the
  battle goes on — so 1 LP per real second from 150 real s = 300 game s on the 2× field clock; `gd.bossOvertimeDue`)
  and leader "扣除目标生命" effects (the sim's `lpLoss` hook: boss_7 Doom, 斥退 …); after every change it is written back
  to the alive players as shares of the LP each brought in (`lpAtFinal`, largest remainder), so `lp` in m.public /
  m.private / m.result is what is left (Σ = team LP).
  Client-side combat (DESIGN §14): a boss field's reports are plausibility-bounded on the SERVER's field clock — the
  credited pool damage of one field ≤ the whole pool per `BOSS_MIN_CLEAR_GS` (5) game s (20 %/s; the balance model's
  fastest mean kills run ≈ 5 %/s per field), its LP cost ≤ 10 + 1 per game s; reports are cumulative, so what exceeds
  the budget is credited later (the boss clock re-applies the latest report), never lost. A boss field's `b.result` ends
  it only when the pool is empty or after the match's `b.end`; a 'cleared' result whose report covers what the pool
  holds waits for the budget instead (`f.heldResult`: no takeover — 999-layer kills take 2–4 game s, DESIGN §20.14);
  any other (a 'forced' result at t = 0, 'cleared' while the pool holds more than the report covers, a result failing
  validation) hands the field to the partner's replica or the server, and the sender is never its authority again
  (`f.demoted`). Every boss field run by the server (takeover, or nobody connected at the
  start) publishes its own damage as `b.pool.acked[fieldId]` (its CreditPool total), so the display replica of a
  reconnecting / watching human stays in sync.
  End and verdict (user playtest #6 item 5): the pool never holds less than 1 HP (`sim/constants.js BOSS_POOL_MIN_HP`:
  the hit — or the per-player credit of a report — that would leave less takes the rest; the browser's `LocalBossPool`
  reads anything below 1 as 0), so a pool shown at 0 is a dead leader on every field and the round ends at once. Before,
  crediting a report per player could leave float dust (3.6e-12) that no browser hit could remove and the leader fought
  on until the overtime drain. The first end condition the server registers decides (`Match._finalEnding`): pool 0 →
  victory, team LP 0 → defeat (PRTS 卫戍协议：盟约 下半 "…使目标生命值扣除至0，则无视倒计时直接失败"); after a forced end
  no report (an in-flight `b.progress`, the final `b.result` with its rounded per-player damage) credits the pool.
  **限伤** (research 11 §2; client `AutoChessStepModeManager._OnBossEnemyTakeDamage`): in both boss rounds a single hit
  on a leader with ceil(damage) ≥ `BOSS_HIT_LIMIT` = 300000 (shared/constants.js; 0 / Infinity = off) is cancelled in the
  sim (`sim/damage.js leaderHitCancelled`, SIM.md §4) — it deals 0 and nothing reaches the shared pool, the per-player
  boss damage or the BOSS_HIT tickers; minions, parts, normal rounds and 联防 are unaffected. The server's own runs, the
  browsers' runs and the server's verification share the rule, so digests agree.

### 3.1 Balance layer (data/tuning.json)
`data/config.json` is generated and stays research-faithful. There is **no custom balance** any more (DESIGN §14
corrections, research 08 §6): enemy numbers are the official ones (the PRTS `enemyScale` table, leader pool =
`bloodPoint`). `data/tuning.json` (hand-maintained, loaded as `data.tuning`, layered on the config by gamedata.js only)
keeps just the result-title rules:

```jsonc
{ "titles": { "comment_3": { "stat": "lpLost", "rule": "min" } } }   // merged over config.titles
```
The former `enemyHpMul` / `enemyAtkMul` / `enemySpeedMul` / `bossHpMul` / `flyPlaceholders` knobs were removed; a
tuning file that still carries them is ignored (`gd.bossHpMul()` always returns 1). `tools/balance.mjs --tuning off`
drops the file (titles only, so the numbers are the same). Titles: `rule: 'min'` ranks the players still alive by the
smallest stat (坚若磐石 "目标生命值损失最少" = least `lpLost`). docs/BALANCE.md has the balance measurements.

---

## 4. 联防 (Unite)
Planned after the normal combats, at the end of the COMBAT_END pause from the players still in (`Match._afterCombat`, so a
player who quit during the last field or the pause is neither a helper nor a leaker whose enemies re-enter; unite.js):
helpers = `unite.js helperOrder` (research 08 §5, PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §联防阶段): ≤ `unite.maxHelpers` (2) perfect players
chosen by most units on the field (downed included) > an active bond > most standing units > seat; the pair ordered by
units > active bond > Σ active layers > standing > seat (LP plays no part), the first one on the right-hand field
(colOffset +8, where escaped_multi enters), the other colOffset 0; the escaped template of that size routes the leaked
enemies by slot class; helpers' operators carry
`{ hpPct, sp, skillActive }` from `unitsEnd` ("阵地以其当前状态"); an operator knocked out at the end of the helper's own
combat carries `{ down: true }` (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助: "部署完成后…上一阶段为退场状态的干员强制退场"): deployed, then forced out
at once, it lies on its tile with the redeploy ring and redeploys like after any knock-out (docs/SIM.md §1.1; user
playtest #5 item 2 — it used to stay out and vanish); its timer is its full redeploy time (the official setup carries
only hp / tech per operator; confirmed by the user), with the redeploy-time effects that start with the battle (机变 征召); summons are
fielded as the board has them; `flags.layerGainsEnabled = false`; time limit = the round's combat limit.
Every enemy still alive at the end (leaked again, or never spawned before the limit) costs its **source** player 1 LP.
A client-run 联防 result may bill a survivor only to a leaker who sent that enemy in — a split / summon only to a leaker
who sent in its parent, ≤ the parents' data offspring count (磨砻 2, 烹泉 4 …; fields.js offspringPerParent).
**Live counter** (user playtest #6 item 7; PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "防卫失败的玩家可通过上方信息栏确认自身所属敌人的剩余数量"):
while the 联防 runs, each leaker's `m.public players[].uniteLeft` = its enemies still standing on the field (not spawned
yet, alive, or through again) + its leaks that could not re-enter — what settlement would charge before the cap —
and `pendingLp` = min(`lpCapPerRound`, uniteLeft) (`Match._uniteLeft`). Sources: the authority's `b.progress.left`
(`{ [leakerId]: n }`, server/sim/spec.js `uniteLeft` / `battleProgress`), the server-run field's timeline samples
(`fields.js timelineSample`: `[gt, killed, total, left]`) read on the field clock, or the streamed battle itself
(legacy mode; `_uniteTick` republishes about once a game second); exact from the field's result once it is done
(`uniteSurvivors`). Live values are clamped to what settlement can bill that leaker (`fields.js uniteBillBounds`: sent
in + the offspring bound). It falls as the helpers strike them down and rises when one splits or summons (the children
carry the leaker); every client that has the 联防 field on screen shows its local replica's counts while it runs — the
leaker's own capsule / row (`ui/hud.js uniteRemaining`) and the leakers' team rows (`ui/teamPanel.js rowLp`
`uniteLocal`, the battle runner's `state().uniteLeft`) — else this value. The settled loss stays min(10, survivors).

---

## 5. Views (DESIGN §8.2 / §8.3) and deviations

`m.public` (throttled ≤ 10/s, only sent when it changed) carries the DESIGN fields plus: `drawnDisabledBonds` (the 3+4
drawn set; `disabledBonds` = drawn ∪ the mode's static list), `hiddenBossId`, `bossRound`, `hiddenRound`, `spRound`,
`combatMode` (`'client'` | `'server'`), `fields[].progress { killed, total, done }` (teammates' progress UI), `paused`
(solo pause, §1.3a),
`players[].autoplay`, `players[].uniteLeft` (UNITE, leakers only: their enemies still standing, uncapped — §4),
`players[].bonds` = `ps.alive ? bondList(gd, ps.bondsView()) : []` — every bond with members, layers or an active tier, the same list
and order as the player's own `m.private bonds` minus `thresholds` / `countsHand` (the client reads those from
bonds.json): a teammate watching the player shows it in the bond strip (DESIGN §20.15); `[]` once the player is
eliminated (nobody can watch them; the result screen reads `m.result`'s own bonds), and per phase: `draft { order, turn, picks, skipsLeft, turnDeadline, turnSeconds, untimed }` (BAND_DRAFT),
`sp { family, name, desc, eventId, cards:[{ idx, kind:'bounty'|'item'|'tactic', id, name, desc, tier, descRaw?, coin?,
payout?, rounds?, enemyKey?, count?, price?, team?, tacticKind? }], order, turn, picks:{pid: idx}, taken:{idx: pid}, untimed }`
(SP_DRAFT), `teamLp` / `bossHp {hp,max}` (Final Assault on), `overtimeAt` (最终攻势 / 隐秘核心: ms epoch when the
overtime drain starts; `deadline` = the level's 120 s countdown), `unite { helpers, leakers }` (UNITE).
`players[].status`: INFO_CHECK ready/deciding · drafts ready (picked) / deciding (their turn) / acting (waiting) ·
PREP ready/acting · COMBAT/boss combat/done · UNITE helping/done · others done · `left` / `dead` override.

`m.private` = DESIGN §8.3 exactly (sent per player whenever it changed). `nextEnemies` = the current round's wave
(+ the player's bounty enemies, tag `bounty`; boss rounds: the player's boss field, tag `boss`, + its bounties).

Bond layers in the views (DESIGN §20.15): from the end of COMBAT (`_finishCombat`, every normal result in) until SETTLE,
`m.private bonds` and `m.public players[].bonds` add the finished battle's IN_BATTLE gains (`PlayerState.pendingLayerGains`
= the result's `layerGains`; `bondsMeta.bondsWithGains`: floored, at most up to `BOND_LAYER_CAP`, like the settlement), so
the strip keeps the layers the battle reached through the COMBAT_END pause and the 联防. Views only: `ps.bonds` /
`ps.layers` (rules, the 联防 spec, `activatedLayers`) are untouched; SETTLE clears the pending gains as it adds them to
`ps.layers` (once); the next round start clears them too.

`m.field` = `{ fieldId, kind, rect, stageId, units, live }`; during prep `g.watch 'n:<pid>'` returns a one-shot board
view with `prep: true` (scouting a teammate).

**`b.snap` / `b.ev` game time**: every frame is `{ t: '<type>', … }`, so the snapshot's game time (DESIGN `b.snap.t`)
is sent as **`gt`** (game seconds); `b.ev` carries the same `gt`. The client reads `gt` (`render/interp.js frameTime`,
used by `normalizeSnapshot`). Legacy server-run mode only: client-side combat sends no `b.snap` / `b.ev`.

`m.result` (unicast to every human, `playerId` = the recipient) = `{ victory, roundsPassed, hiddenReached,
hiddenCleared, reason: 'victory'|'defeat'|'eliminated'|'abandoned'|'error', teamLp (merged Final Assault LP, null before
it; players[].lp are the alive players' shares), modeId, difficulty, stageId, bossId,
hiddenBossId, seed, durationMs, players:[{ playerId, seat, name, isBot, left, alive, victory (the team won AND this
player was still in at the end), roundsPassed,
eliminatedRound, lp, bandId, lineup:[{ id, golden, tier, row, col, items }], bonds, stats:{ dmgDealt, kills, leaks, gold,
refreshes, merges, itemsEquipped, bossDamage, activatedLayers, lpLost, perfectRounds }, title:{ id, name, picId, text }|null,
trophies, reward }] }`. Trophies and 卫戍认证 follow each row's OWN rounds passed (research 06 §6 / §10.4): the
Hidden-Core trophy row only for the players still in when it was cleared — a teammate eliminated or departed earlier
gets the table value of its own rounds. `onEnd(summary)` receives the same object (without `t`, plus `errors`).

`m.emote { playerId, id }`: `id` must be one of `shared/constants.js EMOTES` (`BAD_MSG` otherwise, also when `handle()`
is called without protocol validation); 1 per second per player (`RATE`).

Tickers (`m.ticker { text, id, type, priority, playerId }`) from `config.broadcasts`: SHOP_LEVEL, GOLDEN_CHAR,
CHAR_DAMAGE (per board unit per battle, highest threshold; summons created in battle once per unit type — a client
result may only name the unit types its lineup can field, fields.js validateClientResult), BOSS_HIT (20/50/80 % of the
pool per player), CHAR_GIFT (to the
receiver only), plus CUSTOM texts (eliminations, 联防, hidden core).

## 6. Testing & tools

* `test/match/fakeBattle.js` — scriptable DESIGN §5.1 Battle (`FakeBattle.script = (battle) => plan`); inject with
  `new Match({ …, BattleClass: FakeBattle })`.
* `test/match/harness.js` — `makeMatch(opts)` (virtual scheduler, captured frames, `drive()` for human decisions,
  `toPrep(r)`, `checkInvariants(m)`, `give()/giveItem()` scenario helpers).
* `VirtualScheduler({ instantCombat })`: `advance(ms)`, `runNext()`, `runUntil(pred)`, `runAll()`; with
  `instantCombat` (default) battles run synchronously, so a full match takes milliseconds of wall time.
* Suites: pool, board, economy, merge, bonds, draft, combat (FakeBattle), finalAssault, connection, meta, waves,
  results, fullmatch (fullmatch*.test.js, parallel files, runner fullmatchRun.js — REAL sim: solo × 4 difficulties, co-op
  2/3/4 incl. AI, 20 seeds each; `MATCH_SEEDS=n` to change),
  fuzz (random valid-shaped intents + connection churn), lobby-integration (real server + sockets), realtime (the real
  server + lobby + Match with RealScheduler and the REAL sim: 2 scripted websocket humans + 2 AI from the room to the
  prep of round 4 — drafts, 机变, buying/placing, combat snapshots `gt`, watching, 联防, throttled m.public), bot (field
  model, layout planner, rehearsal side-effect freedom, economy/bench regression).
  `node --test test/match/*.test.js`
* `node tools/matchrun.mjs --mode coop --difficulty HARD --players 4 --seeds 20` — per-round balancing summary / aggregate
  (`--check` audit, `--errors` per-source error table, `--lp N` / `--layers N` to reach late rounds — the boost stops at
  999 per bond —, `--rehearsal N`).
* `node tools/balance.mjs --mode multi --difficulty NORMAL` — the competent-board difficulty model (docs/BALANCE.md):
  per round leaks / LP after 联防 / clear time of representative boards against the real waves, boss damage by 150 s
  and kill time; `--tuning off` (research numbers), `--legacy-time`, `--profile weak|strong`, `--bots N`, `--json`.
  Tests: `test/match/balance.test.js` (tuning layer, model), `test/match/followups.test.js`.

## 7. Assumptions (all documented in module headers)
* Unite helper choice: `unite.js helperOrder` (§4; selection units > active bond > standing units > seat, the pair
  units > active bond > Σ active layers > standing > seat; the ranks marked 存疑 in PRTS). Unite enemies re-enter with
  their original stats on the official 联防 spawn timing (waves.js `buildUniteWave`, DATA.md §15 #22).
* A manual refresh while frozen keeps the new slots frozen until the next round start.
* Level-up does not add slots until the next roll (refresh / round start).
* Buying a second copy of an equipped normal item merges into the golden item in the hand (not equipped).
* Promotions by effects (升华, 博士投影) keep the equipment; merges return it.
* Chess granted by effects need a free pool copy unless `requirePool: false` (then they hold 0 copies).
* Boss-round `local` pack spawns (boss parts) all spawn; content scripts (bosses.js) decide their behaviour.
* The Final Assault ends as a defeat when every field finished with the boss pool above 0 (boss escaped).
* The 999 layer cap holds for every prep-side gain too (the client only shows the in-battle clamp; the scene server's
  code is not in the client — research 11 §1.2). A 限伤-cancelled hit shows no number; a part's damage passed on to its
  leader (Battle.loseHp) meets the limit like a hit (research 11 §2.3).
* Combat limits are real seconds (× 2 in game seconds) — see §3; research 00-INDEX §8 #10 assumed game seconds.
* Emotes faster than 1/s answer `RATE`.
* 中途退出 = elimination at once (research); a quitter's operators already fighting in a shared field (联防, boss
  field) finish that battle, its LP already merged into the team LP stays there.
* After the LP merge (Final Assault) the per-player LP shown is a share of the team LP ∝ the LP each player brought in.
* A 联防 helper's operator knocked out at the end of its own combat is deployed and forced out at once (PRTS 强制退场,
  §4) with HP 0, and redeploys after its full redeploy time: no timer carry (the official setup carries only hp / tech
  per operator), forced out before `battleStart` (its timer re-read after it, so 征召's −50 % applies; 征召's row check
  does not count it), no knock-out hooks (`kill`, 'killed' deaths) a second time.
* A merge completed after the prep (SETTLE effects) keeps its reward offer for the next prep; its elite goes where a prep
  merge's would — onto the tile of a consumed deployed copy (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，则发送至作战区
  对应位置"), else to the hand, overflowing into temp (temp pieces that arrive after the prep wait through the next prep).
