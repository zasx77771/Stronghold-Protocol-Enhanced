# 01 · Core Rules: loop, economy, shop, rounds, modes, strategies (bands)

Scope: 卫戍协议：盟约. The season data is `act2autochess` (盟约 下半, CN start 2026‑03‑14). The data key `act1autochess` is 盟约 上半, kept here for reference only.

Machine-readable companion: `01-core-data.json`. It holds every table below plus the raw data. That includes the per-mode round schedule, shop tables, all 40 bands with buff blackboards, choice effects, tips, broadcasts, bosses and reward factors.

Confidence tags used throughout:
- **[DATA]**: read directly from the client game data (`activity_table.json` and the level JSON files).
- **[WIKI]**: taken from official help text as quoted by PRTS or BWIKI, or from the official patch notes.
- **[COMM]**: community-measured (NGA, Bahamut, bilibili, note.com).
- **[INFER]**: derived from the data by arithmetic.
- **[ASSUMED]**: not documented anywhere I could find. These are proposed values that we can tune.

## 1. Modes (`modeDataDict`) [DATA]

`modeType`: LOCAL = tutorial, SINGLE = 独立模拟 (solo), MULTI = 同盟模拟 (co-op, up to 4 players; also called 联合模拟 in tips).

| modeId | Name / code | Type | Difficulty | specialPhaseTime (s) | Active bonds | Unlock (`preposedMode`) | effectDescList |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- **FUNNY inactive bonds:** lateranoShip, egirShip, kazimierzShip, skillfulShip, arcaneShip, miraShip, investShip, raidShip, soloShip, suntShip.
- **FUNNY and NORMAL also disable 18 dangerous enemies** (`inactiveEnemyKey`, e.g. `enemy_1112_emppnt`, `enemy_1207_sfji`, `enemy_1072_dlancer`…). HARD and ABYSS have none disabled.
- **Mode description (PRTS 下半):** 标准模拟 = "轻松的协议模式，作战环境较为温和，**初始资源更加丰富**，升级条件更加宽松。无法使用全部盟约。可获得卫戍认证并解锁策略。"

Enemy HP and ATK multipliers by mode [WIKI, PRTS 下半]:

| | FUNNY | NORMAL | HARD | ABYSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 独立 (solo) | ×0.7 | ×0.7 | ×0.8 | ×1.0 |
| 同盟 (multi) | ×0.8 | ×0.8 | ×1.0 | ×1.0 |

Solo is shorter and uses lower enemy numbers. Solo has no time limit on prep or choice phases in 下半. You may leave and return within 24 h (`singleReconnectTime`=86400). Trophies (奖杯) are **only** awarded in multi [WIKI + tip].

Reward currency: 卫戍认证 (`act2autochess_token_chess`).

- **Formula:** `baseRewardDataList[roundsCleared].count × difficultyFactor × modeFactor` [INFER; verified against the 250/400/425 per full clear reported on note.com].
- **baseRewardDataList (round → count):** 10, 20, … 100 (R10), 120, 140, 160, 200 (R14).
- **difficultyFactor:** FUNNY 1.0, NORMAL 1.6, HARD 1.7, ABYSS 1.7.
- **modeFactor:** 1.25 for both SINGLE and MULTI.
- **Daily bonus:** earn 200 → +300 ("每日防卫目标", resets 04:00).

### Training (入门协议)
- **Format:** 4 rounds on stage `act1autochess_m01`.
- **Players:** band 歌利亚 (`band_sarkazb`, 45 LP) plus 3 NPC teammates (`trainingNpcList`: 华法琳/阿米娅/杜遥夜 bands). Preset operators only.
- **Boss:** `boss_7` (“萨米的意志”) in R4. R3 has a choice event (`equip_free_1_tr`).
- **Enemy types:** FLY, TIMES, ELEMENT.
- **Bonds:** `trBondIds` = 14 bonds, of which 5 are banned (`trBannedBondIds`: kjerag, stead, indom, swift, visi).
- **Shop:** L1–L6 upgrade 4/4/6/9/12/99. 3 operator slots at every level; the item slot appears only at L5+.
- **Prep time:** 999 s.

## 2. Match lobby → start (`enterStepList`) [DATA]

| Step | Time (s) | Hint at (s) | Title |
|---|---|---|---|
| INFO_CHECK | 25 | 5 | 确认本局信息 |
| BAND_CHECK | 50 | 15 | 选择策略 |
| BATTLE_CHECK | 3 | 0 | 协议启动 |

**INFO_CHECK** shows the match configuration. The screen shows:
- the stage map (`stageDatasDict`, weight 50 each): FUNNY = act1 m01 only; NORMAL = act1 m01–m04 + act2 m01–m04; HARD/ABYSS = act1 m02–m04 + act2 m01–m04. act1 m05–m07 have weight 0 (unused);
- the R14 boss (weighted: boss_1 胄 6, boss_2 铳 6, boss_3 管 6, boss_4 昆图斯 5, boss_5 卢西恩 10, boss_6 阿利斯泰尔 5, boss_7 萨米的意志 5);
- the special-enemy types (3 of FLY/TIMES/ELEMENT/DOT/INVISIBLE/REFLECTION, `specialEnemyNum`=3);
- the **banned bonds ("B位")**. Bonds with `weight`=10 are bannable. 投资人, 调和, 协防, 绝技 have weight 0 and are never banned.
  - Number banned per match: [ASSUMED] 1 core + 1 add-on. The exact count was not found.
  - Tip: "归属于特定盟约的干员只有部分会出现在调度中心内". Proposal: an operator is removed from the pool only if *all* its bonds are inactive or banned [ASSUMED].

**BAND_CHECK:** each player picks one strategy ("策略/分队" = band) from the unlocked bands.
- Tip: "联合模拟在选择策略时可以进行一次跳过". [ASSUMED] Each player is offered 3 random unlocked bands and may reroll once.
- Bands are not exclusive between teammates [ASSUMED].
- Clearing 3 times with a band (`victorCount`=3) grants a corner badge (角标).

**Before the match (out-of-match loadout):**
- Players fill 2 DIY slots at tier V and 2 at tier VI (`chess_char_5_diy1/2`, `chess_char_6_diy1/2`) with their own operators. Community: "自己五阶放一个白铁".
- They can borrow up to **20 support operators** (`borrowCount`=20; "助战8变20人"). These cover NORMAL-type chess they don't own. Otherwise the chess falls back to `backupCharId`.

---

## 3. Round schedule [DATA]

Columns: `turnInfoDataDict` (prep time, boss flags), `battleDataDict` (level, SP flag) and each level's `options.maxPlayTime` (combat time limit).

Definitions:
- `normalPhaseTime` = **prep (休整期) time limit in seconds**. Solo = 300. PRTS 上半: "各轮次均有300秒的决策时间"; in 下半 solo prep became unlimited.
- `isSpPrepare` = this round's prep is preceded by a **机变阶段** (choice event). Community counts it as "decision after round N−1".
- `specialPhaseTime` = the choice-phase timer: multi 16 s per picker (first picker 30 s, ~70 s total); solo 150 s, unlimited in 下半.
- Combat (`maxPlayTime`) is the round level's time limit. Enemies still alive at the limit count as leaked [ASSUMED; community "超时" complaints agree].
- All round levels have DP `initialCost`=10, +1 DP/s, max 99, 8 deploy slots.

### Multi (同盟) — NORMAL / HARD / ABYSS (FUNNY = same but ends at R14 and SP rounds differ)

| R | Prep s | Combat s | Level | SP before prep (FUNNY / NORMAL / HARD+ABYSS) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 65 | 45 | act1_01 | – | first 3 rounds: enemies only use the lower red gate [COMM] |
| 2 | 65 | 45 | act1_02 | – | |
| 3 | 65 | 55 | act1_03 | ✔ / ✔ / ✔ | decision after R2 |
| 4 | 95 | 55 | act1_04 | | upper route enemies from R4 [COMM] |
| 5 | 95 | 55 | act1_05 | | |

| 12 | 125 | 115 | act1_h05 | | |
| 13 | 150 | 115 | act1_h06 | | |
| 14 | 195 | boss (120 s level; −1 LP/s after `bossTurnHpReduceTime`=150 s) | h07_0X (boss_1..7) | | **最终攻势** (Final Assault). Last round for FUNNY. |
| 15 | 195 (NORMAL) / 215 (HARD, ABYSS) | boss | h08_0X (boss_8..10) | | **隐秘核心** (Hidden Core); only if its conditions are met (§10) |

### Solo (独立)

| Mode | Rounds | SP rounds (`isSpPrepare`) | Prep | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| single_funny | **9** | none | 300 | R9 = boss (uses `_S` boss levels). No decisions. |
| single_normal | 14 (+15) | 6, 9 (decisions after R5 = 道具补给, R8 = 战术决策) | 300 | |
| single_hard | 14 (+15) | 3, 9, 11 | 300 | |
| single_abyss | 14 (+15) | 3, 9, 11 | 300 | |

Solo boss levels are the `…_S` variants (`level_act1autochess_h07_0X_S`).

Bosses (`bossInfoDict`, HP pool by difficulty FUNNY / NORMAL / HARD / ABYSS) [DATA]:

| bossId | Enemy | Pick weight | HP F / N / H / A | Hidden |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| boss_1 | 假想敌：胄 | 6 | 247 500 / 675 000 / 1 800 000 / 3 600 000 | |
| boss_2 | 假想敌：铳 | 6 | 225 000 / 400 000 / 800 000 / 3 000 000 | |
| boss_3 | 假想敌：管 | 6 | 285 000 / 708 750 / 2 000 000 / 4 000 000 | |
| boss_4 | 盐风主教昆图斯 | 5 | 307 500 / 708 750 / 2 100 000 / 4 200 000 | |
| boss_5 | 卢西恩，“猩红血钻” (new in act2) | 10 | 200 000 / 390 000 / 780 000 / 3 000 000 | |

| boss_8 | 假想敌：胄 (hidden) | 50 | 750 000 / 937 500 / 3 600 000 / 7 200 000 | ✔ |
| boss_9 | 假想敌：铳 (hidden) | 40 | 675 000 / 900 000 / 2 800 000 / 3 950 000 | ✔ |
| boss_10 | 假想敌：管 (hidden) | 40 | 825 000 / 1 012 500 / 3 800 000 / 7 600 000 | ✔ |

Boss HP scaling:
- The boss HP is one shared pool for the whole team.
- It shrinks when teammates are eliminated or leave [COMM: "联机队友变少，最后boss血条也会变少"].
- Proposal: `hp = bloodPoint × alivePlayers / 4` [ASSUMED]. Solo uses `bloodPoint × 0.25` [ASSUMED].

## 4. Phase flow of one round

```
[round start] ──► (机变阶段 if isSpPrepare) ──► 休整期 (prep) ──► 各自行动阶段 (own combat) ──► 联防 (unite, multi only, if needed) ──► 结算 (settlement) ──► next round
```

### 4.1 Round start ("进入休整期时") — proposed server order [WIKI + ASSUMED order]
1. `round += 1`. If round > 1: `upgradePrice = max(0, upgradePrice − 1)` [WIKI: "升级调度中心所需的资金每回合-1直至0，升级后重置"].
2. `funds = income(round)` + pending coins earned since the last prep (bounties, 暴行-type "下回合加钱", band 玛恩纳, etc.).
   - Funds do **not** carry over [WIKI: "没有用完的资金无法留到下一回合"].
   - Exception, band 坎诺特 (`coin_carry_over {capital:5, interest:1, max:1}`): keep leftovers, +1 if leftover ≥ 5.
3. Destroy everything in the 临时整备区 (temporary overflow bench) [tip: "处于临时整备区的调度资源，在进入下一回合后会自动销毁"].
   *Superseded in the remake (user playtest #3, DESIGN §6.2):* wiping at the round start destroyed what SETTLE had just put
   there (battle-result grants, a SETTLE merge's elite, returned equipment) before the player ever saw it — reported as a
   bug by a player of the official mode. The remake resolves a temp piece at the deadline of the first prep in which its
   player could act on it (the "next round" of the tip = the combat that follows that prep; Ready stays blocked meanwhile).
4. If `isSpPrepare`: run the 机变阶段 choice (§12) before the shop opens.
5. Free automatic shop refresh of all **non-frozen** slots [ASSUMED, auto-chess convention]. Promotion-reward slots from last round are gone.
6. Fire "<进入休整期时>" effects: bands (e.g. 小贾斯汀 R1/4/7/10, 杰西卡 R4/7/10/13, 松桐 on even rounds…), operator traits (garrison), equipment.
7. Start the prep timer (`normalPhaseTime`; solo unlimited in 下半).

### 4.2 Prep (休整期): what a player can do [WIKI/tips/COMM]
- **Buy** an operator (tier price) or an item from the shop. Bought units go to the bench (待部署区/整备区, max 10). If the bench is full, they go to the temp area and are destroyed at the next round.
- **Sell** any operator or item for **1 fund** by dragging it to the shop area. Tip: "拖拽干员至整备区可以直接撤退干员" = drag a board unit to the bench to un-deploy it.
- **Refresh** the shop: 1 fund. Several effects make refreshes free: 奇迹 bond proc, the "补给" choice.
- **Freeze** shop slots. Tip: "调度中心即使冻结，依然可以主动刷新". [ASSUMED] Freezing is per slot and free. Frozen slots survive refreshes and the next round start; toggle to unfreeze.
- **Upgrade** the 调度中心 (shop level 1→6) at the current price. Broadcast: "{0}博士将调度中心等级提升为{1}级".
- **Arrange** the board: max 8 deployed operators. Grid position matters for traits (前方/周围4格/8格, 同一行, 最右边…).
- **Equip** items to operators on the board or the bench (下半 allows the bench). Use 法术 (MAGIC) items on map tiles.
- **Look** at teammates' boards and at the enemies for this round (right-top magnifier: route / enemy preview).
- **Emotes** (multi). **Ready** (准备): cancellable until all players are ready. Once everyone is ready, combat starts ("全体参与者就绪之前可随时取消准备").
- At prep end: fire "<休整期结束时>" effects (e.g. 助力 +2 layers to all active bonds), then funds are cleared.

### 4.3 Combat (各自行动阶段)
Each player fights their own copy of the round level independently. There is no PvP.
- **Deployment:** automatic, paying DP (start 10, +1/s). **Redeploy also costs DP** [COMM].
- **Deploy order:**
  - 上半: left→right, bottom→top.
  - 下半: top→bottom, then left→right. The last-placed unit has the highest taunt.
- **Skills:** fire automatically. Units with summons deploy the summon on first deployment regardless of SP [COMM].
- **Perfect clear (完美作战):** every enemy killed before the time limit, none reached the objective.
- **Bond stacking:**
  - "<战斗中>" triggers work only here, never in 联防 or boss rounds [COMM].
  - Layers persist all match. Tip: "叠加的盟约会在单次模拟中始终保留，但只有在盟约被激活时才会发挥作用".
  - Only active bonds gain layers in most cases.

### 4.4 联防 (Unite / joint defense), multi only [WIKI]
- **Trigger:** some but not all players failed to clear perfectly.
- **Setup:** 1–2 players who *did* clear perfectly field their board as-is. They face the **union of all enemies the other players leaked**, using the escaped-battle template `level_act1autochess_escaped_multi` (char limit 20).
- **Rules:**
  - Bond stacking is disabled ("该阶段不能叠加层数").
  - Bounty kills here pay the killer.
  - Only perfect-clear teammates can defend (tip).
  - Community: in 下半 the result shown is the *defended* player's view.
- **LP loss:** enemies that also survive 联防 cost their original owner LP (cap 10 per round).
- **No perfect player:** leaks cost LP directly.
- **Partner choice:** [ASSUMED] the defenders are the 2 perfect players with the fewest leaks this round, tie broken by seat index. The official selection rule is unknown.

### 4.5 Settlement
- Each player loses `min(10, number of their enemies not killed)` LP [WIKI: "每回合最多-10血 (就算大漏50个也-10)"]. `enemy.lifePointReduce` is 1 for almost all regular enemies. Use 1 per enemy (see 05-enemies-levels.md).
- **Bounty coins:**
  - Kill-type bounty: whoever kills the enemy (owner or 联防 helper) gets the coins.
  - "战术特训" type: coins if the chooser cleared perfectly in their own phase.
- Coins are credited to the next prep.
- **Elimination:** LP ≤ 0 → the player is out.
  - Multi: their operators return to the shared pool immediately [COMM]. Boss HP drops.
  - Community calls ≤10 LP "斩杀线" (one bad round kills you).
- Score/rewards use rounds cleared (`roundScoreDataList`, `baseRewardDataList`).

## 5. Economy

### 5.1 Income per round
- **Official text:** "每回合开始时，将会进入休整期并且提供一定量的资金…没有用完的资金无法留到下一回合。" The amounts are not published.
- **Evidence:**
  - Band 老鲤 `give_coin_in_round`: R1 = 0, R2 = 0, **R3 = 15**. It reads "第1、2回合的资金暂存至第3回合发放", so **R1+R2+R3 = 15**.
  - Linear +1/round then gives **4, 5, 6**. Start 3 gives 12 and start 5 gives 18, so only 4 fits.
  - NGA: "2回合升本…亏一块". The R2 upgrade costs 4, and 5 − 4 = 1 is left over, which only fits R2 = 5.
  - NGA: "3回合都做不到连买三张". With 6 funds at shop L2, three purchases are impossible.
- **Proposal:** `income(r) = min(3 + r, 10)` → 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10…
  - Cap 10 [ASSUMED]. The 2024 season capped at 10–12, and cap 12 is a fine alternative.
  - FUNNY: +2 per round [ASSUMED].
- **Other income sources [DATA]:**
  - Bounties (1–6 coins).
  - Choice "财富" (+1 to every teammate).
  - Bonds: 远见 "<每叠加10层>获得一次2资金"; 奇迹 "<每叠加100层>获得20资金" and chance of a free next refresh.
  - Items: 骑士储蓄罐 (1–6), 炎 VI items (+2 per acquisition, max 3/round).
  - Operator traits: 红豆 0-cost, 暴行 "下回合加钱"…
  - Bands: 玛恩纳 (+1 per Kazimierz bought, max 3), 坎诺特 interest, 鸭爵 (+1 per duck-type enemy killed).

### 5.2 Spending [DATA unless noted]

| Action | Cost |
|---|---|
| Buy operator (`shopCharChessInfoData`) | tier I **2**, II **3**, III **3**, IV **3**, V **4**, VI **4**. The same price is charged if the shop offers an elite copy (e.g. "升华" choice). |
| Buy item (`trapChessDataDict.purchasePrice`) | 1–5 by item (tier I items 1, most tier II–IV 2, tier VI 3–4, advanced/金 items 5). See 04-items.md. |
| Refresh | 1 (`shopRefreshPrice`) |
| Sell (operator of any tier, normal *or* elite) | refund **1** (`chessSoldPrice`=1 for all rows). Community special case: selling 煌 gives 1 fund + transforms. |
| Upgrade shop level N→N+1 | `initialUpgradePrice[N]` − rounds elapsed since reaching N (floor 0) |

Shop upgrade base prices (`shopLevelDataDict`, price shown at level N = cost to go N→N+1) [DATA]:

| Mode | L1→2 | L2→3 | L3→4 | L4→5 | L5→6 | Operator slots at L1..L6 | Item slots |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NORMAL / HARD / ABYSS (solo & multi) | 5 | 8 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 3,4,4,5,5,5 | 1 at every level |
| multi_funny | 5 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 11 | 3,4,4,4,4,5 | 1 |
| single_funny | 1 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10 | 3,4,4,4,4,5 | 1 |
| training | 4 | 4 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 3 ×6 | 0 (L1–4), 1 (L5–6) |

Level 6 has price 99 (no further upgrade). Level tag colours: #434343, #626654, #445760, #615B74, #6C5E41, #5d341e.

The 20-fund 绮良 / 55-fund 帕格尼尼 band thresholds count **funds spent** (buy, refresh and upgrade) [ASSUMED: all spending].

---

## 6. Shop (调度中心)

- **Slots:** `charChessCount` operator slots + `itemCount` item slots, total ≤ `storeCntMax` = 6.
- **Tier availability:** shop level L offers operators of tier ≤ L [WIKI/COMM: "商店等级决定会卖的干员最高阶级"]. Items also ≤ L [ASSUMED].
- **Chess counts per tier (`charShopChessDatas`, 133 chess):**

  | Tier | Visible (PRESET / NORMAL / DIY slots) | Hidden (not in shop; only granted by effects) |
  |---|---|---|
  | I | 16 PRESET | 4 (incl. Pith's special 盟约·辅助干员) |
  | II | 17 PRESET | 2 |
  | III | 13 PRESET + 6 NORMAL | 2 |
  | IV | 9 PRESET + 13 NORMAL | 4 |
  | V | 2 PRESET + 17 NORMAL + 2 DIY | 3 PRESET + 1 NORMAL (百炼嘉维尔) |
  | VI | 2 PRESET + 17 NORMAL + 2 DIY | 1 (妮芙) |

  Chess types:
  - PRESET = fixed system operator.
  - NORMAL = uses the player's own operator (or a borrowed support). If neither is available it uses `backupCharId` (预备干员).
  - DIY = a player-chosen own operator in a tier V/VI slot.
- **Shared pool (multi) [COMM, bilibili BV1JWy3BkEpt + note.com]:**
  - Each operator has a fixed number of copies shared by all 4 players: **I 12, II 14, III 18, IV 16, V 8, VI 5** (缪尔赛思 4).
  - An elite occupies 3 copies. Copies in a shop display do **not** occupy the pool.
  - All owned copies (board + bench, however obtained) do.
  - If owned copies ≥ cap, that operator can no longer roll.
  - Eliminated or quitting players' copies return immediately.
  - DIY slots: [ASSUMED] private per player, with the same copy caps as their tier.
- **Roll odds [ASSUMED; the official odds are unpublished]:**
  - Each empty operator slot draws one copy uniformly at random from **all remaining pool copies** of non-hidden chess with tier ≤ shop level (Hearthstone-Battlegrounds model).
  - This matches community observations: "一本卡池最小所以好凑三连", "三本大大稀释浓度", "卡池变大了三连概率低".
  - Resulting share of tiers at L6 ≈ I 14%, II 17%, III 25%, IV 26%, V 11%, VI 7%.
  - Optional: never show the same operator twice in one roll, except via 梓兰's special refresh.
- **Special refreshes:** band effects replace the normal roll.
  - 杜遥夜: first 2 active refreshes each round guarantee 1 Yan.
  - 梓兰: every refresh contains 2 copies of one operator and freezes one.
  - 佩佩: after upgrading to L2/4/6, one Sargon-priority refresh.
  - 寻呼模块 / 信标: special 3- or 2-choice refresh.
- **Promotion reward slot:** see §7. Tip: "晋级的特殊奖励无法被刷新、冻结，也不会保留至下一回合".

## 7. Merging (精锐 / elite promotion) [DATA + WIKI]

- **Merge rule:** 3 copies with the same `chessId` merge automatically into `upgradeChessId`, the `_b` elite. Copies on the board or bench all count.
  - WIKI: "三位同名干员（无论是否部署）会自动合并且晋级为精锐干员".
  - `upgradeNum`=3 for 132 chess; **风丸 `chess_char_2_11_a` needs 2**.
  - Elites have `upgradeNum`=0: **no further merging**.
- **Where the elite goes:** to the hand, **unless a consumed copy was deployed — then to that copy's board position**.
  PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §干员的获得与精锐化: "发送1名【精锐】状态的该干员至手牌区（若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，则发送至作战区对应位置）";
  confirmed first-hand by the user after playtest #6 ("合成精锐时，如果消耗了场上的干员，精锐会出现在场上那个位置"). See A1 row 7
  for the remake's choices where the text is silent.
- **Equipment:** anything the merged units carried returns to the bench. Tip: "干员晋级后已配发装备会回收至整备区".
- **Bond traits** of "<获得时>" type: a triple stacks 1+1+2 (the elite value is double) [COMM].
- **Stats (`shopCharChessInfoData`):**

  | Tier | Normal copy | Elite copy |
  |---|---|---|
  | I | E1 Lv55, skill 4 | E2 Lv50, skill 7, module lv1 |
  | II | E1 Lv60 | E2 Lv55 |
  | III–V | E2 Lv1, skill 4 | E2 Lv60, skill 7, module lv1 |
  | VI | E2 Lv1, skill 4 | E2 Lv60, skill 7, module lv3 |

  Trust 0. Owned-operator training adds `cultivateEffectList`: E1 +5% ATK/DEF; E2 +10% ATK, +5% DEF/HP; E2 Lv60 +10% all.
- **Promotion reward [COMM]:** after a merge the player gets a special shop offer. They pick **1 of 3 random operators of tier min(shopLevel+1, 6)**, free.
  - Sources: "碰出來可以選一個階級+1的幹員"; "资金0でランダムに選ばれた3体の中から1体"; NGA "卡一本…三连给的二本".
  - Reward pools are named `pool_chess_shop_{N}_reward` in the data (老鲤 draws from `pool_chess_shop_2_reward` / `_4_reward`).
  - It cannot be refreshed or frozen and expires at round end.
- **Broadcast:** "{0}博士的{1}干员晋升为精锐".

---

## 8. Board, bench and bonds (limits only; details in 02-bonds.md)
- **Board:** 8 deployed operators (`maxBattleChessCnt`, level `characterLimit`=8).
- **Bench:** 10 (`maxDeckChessCnt`), plus a temporary overflow area that is wiped each round.
- **Board and bench swaps:** in 下半 operators on the bench and the board can be swapped even with a full bench.
- **Bond activation:** most bonds count only board operators (`activeCondition` BOARD).
  - 远见 / 奇迹 / 投资人 are BOARD_AND_DECK: bench units count too. Tip: "一些特殊的盟约不需要部署干员也能激活生效".
  - `fallbackBondId`=emptyShip (协防干员): the bond for operators with no faction bond.

---

## 9. Life points (目标生命值)
- **Start:** the band's `totalHp`: 20 (铃兰) … 45 (歌利亚). See §11.
- **Normal rounds:** lose 1 per enemy not killed (leaked or alive at timeout, after 联防), **max 10 per round** (`costPlayerHpLimit`=10) [DATA+WIKI].
- **Loss:** LP ≤ 0 → eliminated.
  - Multi: the team wins if anyone survives to kill the R14 boss [ASSUMED: the team result is shared, and the clear counts for everyone still in].
  - Quitting counts as elimination.
- **Final assault (R14/R15):**
  - All remaining LP of all players merge into one pool; there is no 10 cap.
  - After the boss round has run `bossTurnHpReduceTime` = 150 s, the team loses 1 LP per second.
  - If regular wave enemies reach the goal and bring LP to 0, the team fails immediately [WIKI].

## 10. Final Assault and Hidden Core [WIKI, PRTS 下半]
- **最终攻势 (R14):**
  - Players are paired. Each pair shares one boss battlefield: one plays the left half and one the right half ("两名参与者会处于同一个战场，但无法查看另一组队友的战场情况").
  - For the right-side player the board is mirrored ("你的最左边是你的最右边").
  - Everyone damages one shared boss HP bar ("所有人将一起对敌方领袖造成伤害"). Some bosses appear on both sides and share HP.
  - Broadcasts at 20/50/80% damage share per player: "{0}博士对敌方领袖造成的伤害超过20%!".
- **隐秘核心 (R15, NORMAL+ only):**
  - Entry condition after passing R14:
    - solo: activated bond layers total **> 350** and LP > 1;
    - multi: sum over all players **> 1200** and LP sum > 1.
    - (盟约 上半 values were 300 / 1000.)
  - The boss is weighted among 胄/铳/管 hidden versions (50/40/40).
  - Failing it does not affect the clear or the reward. Success shows a special banner and awards more trophies.

## 11. Strategies / bands (`bandDataListDict`, 40 entries) [DATA]

A band is the player's commander/"分队" chosen at BAND_CHECK. It sets **starting LP** (`totalHp`) and grants one permanent rule-changing effect (`effectType` BAND_INITIAL). Common fields: `victorCount`=3 (3 clears → badge) and `bandRewardModulus`=1.0.

`band_zumama` (森蚺, 上半 only) is defined in `autoChessData.bandDataDict` but absent from act2.

Modes column: L=LOCAL(training), S=SINGLE, M=MULTI. Raw rich-text is kept in the JSON as `descRaw`.

## 12. 机变阶段: choice events (`effectChoiceInfoDict`, 109 entries incl. `_s` solo variants) [DATA + WIKI]

| choiceType | effectType | Name | Ids | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EQUIP_FREE | EQUIP | 道具补给 | equip_free_1..4 (+_tr) | Pick 1 free item |
| EQUIP_FREE | EQUIP | 机密商店 | artifact_paid_1..5 | Pick 1 free (special) item |
| BOUNTY_HUNT | ENEMY_GAIN | 悬赏决策 | enemy_initial_1..10, bounty_hunter_1..15, bossInitial_1..6 | Pick a bounty: extra enemies in your next 1 / 2 / all battles; coins on kill or on perfect |
| BUFF_SELECT | BUFF_GAIN | 战术决策 | buff_select_1..4, hardbuff_select_1..3, terrain_m01_1…m07_1 | Team buff, enemy debuff or map change |
| PERSONAL_CHOOSE | ENEMY_GAIN | 悬赏决策 | hunter_band_1 | Personal bounty pick (pool server-side) |

The `_s` ids are the solo copies with identical text.

When they happen:
- Rounds with `isSpPrepare`. PRTS (multi): FUNNY after R2/R8 (no bounties); NORMAL after R2/R5/R8; HARD+ after R2/R8 (bounties fixed) and R10 (no 战术决策).
- Solo NORMAL: R5 道具补给, R8 战术决策.
- Proposed mapping [ASSUMED]:
  - HARD/ABYSS: R3 = bounty (enemy_initial / bounty_hunter tier I–II); R9 = bounty (tier II–III); R11 = 道具补给 or 机密商店.
  - NORMAL: R3 bounty, R6 道具补给, R9 战术决策.
  - FUNNY: R3 道具补给, R9 战术决策.

Choice format:
- **Multi:** 6 options shared by the team. Players pick 1 each in turn (first picker 30 s, others 16 s, `specialPhaseTime`=16, ~70 s total).
- **Solo:** 3 options (3选1), time unlimited in 下半.
- Effects worded "若存在其他队友则他们也获得" apply to everyone.

Bounty semantics (buff keys) [DATA]:
- **Kill bounty** `add_enemy_kill_gain_coin {count, enemy_id, coin, round}`:
  - Adds `count` copies of `enemy_id` to the chooser's next `round` battles (99 = all remaining).
  - Whoever kills it (the chooser or a 联防 teammate) gets `coin`.
  - `enemyPrice` = coin value (1–6).
- **Perfect bounty** `add_enemy_selfbattle_win_gain_coin` / `next_battle_add_enemy_win_gain_coin` ("战术特训"): adds enemies; coins only if the chooser clears perfectly in their own phase.
- **多轮悬赏 · 假想敌 (enemyInitial_1..6):** adds 1 imaginary enemy to every subsequent battle, 1 coin each kill.

Team buffs (BUFF_GAIN, `allybuff_select_*`):
- 列装: 2 random tier‑I items.
- 盟誓 x8: bond layers +8…12 for specific bonds.
- 财富: +1 fund.
- 补给: next 2 refreshes free, stackable.
- 整备: next item bought is advanced.
- 升华: next operator bought is elite.
- 驰援 x8: 1 random operator of a nation bond.
- 自愈, 火力, 征召, 无瑕, 锐利.

Enemy debuffs (`enemydebuff_select_1..9`): all/elite/leader enemies get −ATK%, −DEF or −RES.

Map changes (`map_m0X_*`): remove barricades, turn them into shooting platforms, stop a sandstorm, remove bushes.

The full list of 182 choice, enemy and char-map effects is in Appendix A.

Enemy-side global modifiers (`aceffect_enemy_*`, type ENEMY):
- 急行军: move speed +15%.
- 补给线: HP +8%; 补给线II: HP +20%.
- 攻坚装备: ATK +10%, HP +20%.
- 攻坚装备II: ×0.8 / ×0.8.
- 攻坚装备III: ATK ×0.7, HP ×0.75.

The last two look like the solo/easy stat reductions. [ASSUMED] Map them per mode as in §1.

### Game tips (`gameTipsList`, all weight 50), CN → EN
1. 只有在联合模拟中才能获得奖杯 → Trophies are only earned in co-op (joint) simulation.
2. 联合模拟在选择策略时可以进行一次跳过 → In co-op you may skip once while choosing a strategy.
3. 归属于特定盟约的干员只有部分会出现在调度中心内 → Only some operators of certain alliances appear in the Dispatch Center.
4. 调度中心即使冻结，依然可以主动刷新 → Even when frozen, the Dispatch Center can still be manually refreshed.
5. 晋级的特殊奖励无法被刷新、冻结，也不会保留至下一回合 → Special promotion rewards can't be refreshed or frozen and don't carry to the next round.
6. 处于临时整备区的调度资源，在进入下一回合后会自动销毁 → Resources in the temporary bench are destroyed when the next round begins.
7. 一些特殊的盟约不需要部署干员也能激活生效 → Some special alliances activate without deploying operators.
8. 干员晋级后已配发装备会回收至整备区，需要重新配置 → After promotion, equipped items return to the bench and must be re-equipped.
9. 两件同名装备可以合成一件更强力的装备 → Two identical items merge into a stronger one.
10. 特定的装备组合可以为干员赋予额外的盟约效果 → Certain item combos grant an operator an extra alliance.
11. 叠加的盟约会在单次模拟中始终保留，但只有在盟约被激活时才会发挥作用 → Alliance stacks persist for the whole run but only work while the alliance is active.
12. 多数情况下只有已经激活的盟约才可进行叠加 → Usually only active alliances can gain stacks.
13. 休整期可以查看队友的战场情况 → During the rest phase you can view teammates' battlefields.
14. 休整期可以查看当前回合即将迎击的敌方单位 → During the rest phase you can view this round's incoming enemies.
15. 拖拽干员至整备区可以直接撤退干员 → Drag an operator to the bench to withdraw it.
16. 全体参与者就绪之前可随时取消准备，准备战斗后将无法进行操作 → You can cancel Ready until everyone is ready; after the battle starts no actions are possible.
17. 只有达成完美作战的队友可以进行联防 → Only teammates with a perfect clear can join the joint defense.
18. 进行联防时，盟约不会继续叠加 → Alliances don't gain stacks during joint defense.
19. 最终攻势中，两名参与者会处于同一个战场，但无法查看另一组队友的战场情况 → In the Final Assault, two participants share one battlefield but can't see the other pair's.
20. 最终攻势中，所有人将一起对敌方领袖造成伤害 → In the Final Assault, everyone damages the enemy leader together.
21. 达成特定的条件，可在最终攻势后解锁隐秘核心 → Meeting certain conditions unlocks the Hidden Core after the Final Assault.

## 14. Implementation notes for an authoritative server

Proposed server state per player:

```
{ lp, funds, pendingFunds, shopLevel, upgradePrice, roundsAtLevel, shopSlots[6]{chessId|itemId, frozen, special},
  board[8]{chessId,pos,items[]}, bench[10], tempBench[], bondLayers{bondId:int}, spentTotal, refreshCountRound, perfectThisRound, eliminated }
```

- Shared state: `pool{chessId:copiesLeft}` (multi), `round`, `phase`, `choiceQueue`, `bannedBonds`, `bossId`, `stageId`, `teamLp` (final).
- Phase timers come from `turnInfoDataDict[mode][round].normalPhaseTime`. When a timer expires, auto-ready the player; they keep whatever they did. The combat limit comes from the round level's `maxPlayTime`.
- Round-start order and settlement: §4.
- Pool bookkeeping must be atomic, since two players can buy the last copy at once. Shop-displayed copies are not reserved, so the purchase fails if the pool is empty [COMM behaviour].
- Merge check runs after every acquisition, including gifts, band grants and item effects. Board and bench copies both count.
- Suggested defaults for undocumented values:
  - income `min(3+r, 10)`, FUNNY +2;
  - copy-weighted shop roll;
  - per-slot free freeze;
  - banned bonds per match: 1 core + 1 add-on;
  - boss HP `× alive/4` (solo ×0.25).

---

## 15. Open questions
1. **Exact income after R3, and the cap.** The formula is inferred: `3+r` is solid for R1–R3 only; the cap of 10 is a guess (could be 12). FUNNY's "更加丰富" bonus is unknown.
2. **Official shop tier odds.** Unpublished. The copy-weighted model is consistent with community remarks but unverified.
3. **Number of bonds banned per match** and exactly which operators disappear ("只有部分会出现").
4. **Band offer count and skip semantics** at BAND_CHECK (3 offered + 1 reroll assumed).
5. **Which choice-event ids occur at which SP round** (server-side pools). The same applies to the `pool_*` contents.
6. **Boss HP scaling** with player count, and solo boss HP.
7. **联防 defender selection** when more than 2 players are perfect. Whether 1 or 2 defenders fight (PRTS: "1~2名").
8. **Round-15 hidden boss selection.** Is it weighted random, or tied to the R14 boss? Thresholds: 下半 350/1200 vs 上半 300/1000. The sibling doc 05 uses 300/1000; act2 should use **350/1200**.
9. **Whether the team result counts for eliminated players** (trophies are by "自身的通过回合数", i.e. per player rounds survived).

## Addendum (critic)

Written by the completeness critic on 2026-09-27, after cross-reading 01–07. New sources:
- PRTS `卫戍协议/帮助` and the raw wikitext of `卫戍协议：盟约_下半` §开始模拟.
- The raw wikitext of the BWIKI page `盟约` and of `盟约/S.W.E.E.P.报告`.
- The official gameplay-intro long image (`img.71acg.net/sykb~bbs/pc/1763033996225879`, 800×13685, in 10 slices).
- The TW/CN screenshots already listed in 06 §15.
- The official 3/27 notice (`ak.hypergryph.com/news/8584`).

Local copies are in `scratchpad/gd/extra/critic/` (`bw_盟约.txt`, `bw_sweep.txt`, `bw_卫戍协议_1.txt`, `intro_00..09.jpg`, screenshots). Tags: **[VERIFIED]** = from an official or wiki rule text or a screenshot. **[ASSUMED]** = still a proposal.

### A1. Corrections and confirmations to this file

| § | Was | Now | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0, 5.1 | income R1–R3 = 4/5/6 inferred. Cap 10. FUNNY +2 | **R1 = 4, R2 = 5, R3 = 6 confirmed by screenshots.** R1 = 4: official intro (标准, round 1, funds 4, board empty) and TW client R1. R2 = 5: TW R2, upgrade price 4. R3 = 6: official intro 标准 R3 and the co-op 道具补给 screenshot at R3. **FUNNY gets no bonus** (the official intro shows 4 at R1 in 标准). Cap still unknown: **recommend `income(r) = min(3 + r, 12)`**, because the predecessor 卫戍协议 (2024) used "从第2回合开始每回合获得资金数+1，上限12" and 盟约's upgrade prices (5/8/11/12/13) are one step above 2024's (5/6/8/11/12). Keep the cap in config (10 is the alternative). | VERIFIED R1–R3; cap ASSUMED |
| 4.1 | round-start auto refresh [ASSUMED] | Confirmed: "进入此阶段时，触发<进入休整期时>的效果，分配一定资金，刷新调度中心未被冻结的位置". Income is granted **before** the 机变 phase: funds are visible behind every 机变 overlay screenshot. | VERIFIED |
| 4.2 / 14 | freeze per slot [ASSUMED] | **One 冻结 button freezes ALL unsold slots**, operators and item: "【冻结】会将当前整备区的全部未售出栏位冻结，将其保留至下一回合。点击【解冻】可以解除该操作". The freeze is consumed at the next round start. In the official intro, frozen cards reappear in R3 and the button reads 冻结 again. A manual refresh is allowed while frozen (tip 4) and rerolls every slot, frozen ones included (2024 rule "重新调配包括冻结中的所有干员和道具"). Keep a per-slot `frozen` flag internally, because 梓兰 freezes one card. | VERIFIED |
| new | – | At **combat start, all unfrozen shop contents are cleared** ("进入作战期后，栏上若未处于冻结状态则清空全部物资"). | VERIFIED |
| 4.2 / 8 | bench 10 + temp area | **Hand (手牌区/整备区) = 10 regular + 5 temporary slots**, shared by operators, **items** and hand-deployable **summons**. Several summons of one owner stack into 1 slot; summons of different owners don't stack.<br>When the regular hand is full, every action that would add a card is refused: buy, and withdraw from the board. Exception: a purchase that completes a 3-merge nets −1 card, so allow it.<br>Passive gains (merge result, band/trait/item grants, items returned by promotion) overflow into the temp slots. **While temp is non-empty the player cannot start combat.** Temp is wiped when the next phase starts.<br>A board↔hand swap is allowed even with a full hand. Cards fill hand slots **right→left**. | VERIFIED |
| 5.2 | – | **Items cannot be sold** ("多余的装备无法进行出售，可以销毁"). They can only be destroyed for 0 funds. Operators sell for 1 from board or hand. | VERIFIED |
| 7 | promotion reward [COMM] | Confirmed (PRTS 帮助, BWIKI, official intro). On acquiring the 3rd copy:<br>1. The 3rd copy is not created, and the 2 owned copies are destroyed wherever they are.<br>2. **1 elite goes to the hand — or, when a consumed copy was deployed, to that copy's board position** (PRTS 帮助 "发送1名【精锐】状态的该干员至手牌区（若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，则发送至作战区对应位置）"; the user confirmed it first-hand after playtest #6 — this row used to read "not to a board tile", a misreading of the same sentence). Their equipment returns to the hand ("干员晋级后已配发装备会回收至整备区，需要重新配置"). [ASSUMED] where the text is silent: with two or three deployed copies the elite takes the tile of the one that deploys first (top→bottom, then left→right — the official deploy order) with its facing; a deployed operator transformed into the completing copy (突变细胞) counts as deployed; the copies' summons leave and the elite's own summon card joins the hand (§战斗部署 "如果部署的干员拥有可手动部署的附属召唤物，则该召唤物会立刻加入手牌区"); the deploy count never grows.<br>3. The shop then temporarily shows **3 operators of tier min(shopLevel+1, 6) at price 0**. The official intro shows "II 0 ×3" after a tier-I merge at L1 and "III 0 ×3" at L2.<br>4. The player takes **1**. The offer cannot be refreshed or frozen and expires at round end. | VERIFIED (elite to the copy's board position: PRTS + the user); the tile among several deployed copies ASSUMED |
| 2 | BAND_CHECK "3 random + reroll" [ASSUMED] | **All unlocked bands are shown.** In co-op, players pick **one at a time in a random order** shown on the left ("以随机顺序进行策略轮选"). Each co-op player may **skip once**. The step lasts 50 s; on timeout the band is 华法琳. **Duplicates are allowed:** the official illustration shows 2 teammates' picks still un-greyed in the grid. [ASSUMED] 12 s per turn inside the 50 s step. | VERIFIED except the per-turn timer |
| 2 | banned bonds "1 core + 1 add-on" [ASSUMED] | Replaced by the verified rule in **A2**. | VERIFIED |
| 1, 12 | one ×0.7/×0.8 multiplier per mode; `aceffect_enemy_*` mapping [ASSUMED] | Replaced by the **per-round table in A3**. | VERIFIED (PRTS, user-sourced) |
| 4.3 | "automatic, paying DP" | At battle start **all board units deploy for free**, one by one in order: 下半 top→bottom, then left→right; right-side players in the boss round are mirrored.<br>**DP starts at 10, +1/s, cap 99.** These are the round-level `options`. `initialCost` 0 in `m0X` is the terrain file, not the round level.<br>DP is only spent on **automatic redeploy**: the unit returns to its original tile when its respawn timer is done, the tile is free, and DP ≥ `cost`.<br>Deploy effects do not fire during prep placement. Battle speed is forced to **2×**. | VERIFIED |
| 4.3 | leaked/timeout | When `maxPlayTime` ends, the battle stops. Every enemy not killed (still alive, or reached the goal) is "未击倒" and feeds 联防/LP. [ASSUMED] `maxPlayTime` is **game-time** seconds, so the client at 2× shows it ticking twice as fast. Last spawns land at 15/38/73 s against limits of 45/55/115 s, which leaves the time needed to kill walkers. | VERIFIED + ASSUMED unit |
| 3 | solo prep 300 s | 下半 solo has **no timer** on prep or 机变 ("休整期及机变阶段没有时间限制…24小时内随时返回"). Treat `normalPhaseTime` 300 and `specialPhaseTime` 150 as an optional "timed solo" setting. | VERIFIED |
| 4.4 | 联防 partner rule "fewest leaks" | Meaningless, because helpers are perfect by definition. There are **at most 2 helpers**: "所有防卫成功的玩家（最多2名）". Default choice: highest LP, then seat index [ASSUMED]. 1 helper uses `escaped_single` (8 units); 2 helpers use `escaped_multi` (20). | VERIFIED cap |
| 10 | Final Assault | Players are paired. **With an odd count the leftover player forms their own group** ("如有落单的玩家将单独成组") and uses the `_s` map.<br>**Movable bosses spawn one per alive player's side** and share the HP pool ("对于可移动的领袖敌人，将在每个存活玩家的一侧生成并行动").<br>**The boss HP pool is not affected by the A3 multipliers** ("领袖单位于服务器的生命值加成不受上述加成影响").<br>Overtime −1 LP/s starts at `bossTurnHpReduceTime` = 150 s. The level's 120 s `maxPlayTime` is not a hard stop in boss rounds: "计时结束后战斗仍然会继续".<br>Wave enemies that bring the merged LP to 0 end the match at once. | VERIFIED |
| 3 (table) | multi FUNNY = 14 rounds | Confirmed from data: **multi FUNNY has 14 rounds, no R15.** **Solo FUNNY has 9 rounds** (boss `h07_01_S` at R9). The 05 doc's "FUNNY has 9 rounds" applies to solo only. | VERIFIED |

### A2. Per-match disabled bonds and banned operators (VERIFIED)

**Rule.** At INFO_CHECK the server picks a disabled bond set `D`. **An operator is removed from the pool iff every one of its bonds is in `D`** (or in the mode's static `inactiveBondIdList`).

**Proof 1.** Screenshot `i.meee.com.tw/9H7Kugy.png` (终极, 下半, in-match dropdown "本局禁用干员情况") shows these banned counts per bond: 维多利亚 **7**, 阿戈尔 **6**, 谢拉格 **5**, 精准 **5**, 助力 **5**, 奥术 **4**, 奇迹 **3**. Take D = those 7 bonds and count the visible, non-DIY act2 chess whose `bondIds ⊆ D`. The result is exactly 7/6/5/5/5/4/3, over 25 operators. An exact match on 7 numbers cannot be coincidence.

**Proof 2.** The official intro (上半 标准) greys only 坚守. Its 本局禁用干员 list shows exactly the 2 chess whose only bond is 坚守 (tier I and tier V).

```
core   = bonds with autoChessData.bondInfoDict[b].isPower  (8)
addon  = other bonds with weight > 0                        (11; 投资人/调和/协防干员/绝技 have weight 0 → never disabled)
D      = weightedSample(core, Nc) ∪ weightedSample(addon, Na)       // all weights are 10 → uniform
banned = { visible non-DIY chess c : c.bondIds ≠ [] ∧ c.bondIds ⊆ (D ∪ mode.inactiveBondIdList) }  (+ their _b elites)
```

- **Nc/Na:**
  - Observed: 终极 3 core greyed in 2 separate matches, with 3 + 4 in the dropdown. 上半 标准: 0 + 1.
  - **Recommend NORMAL/HARD/ABYSS = 3 core + 4 add-on.** A simulation gives a mean of 22 banned operators (range 12–29).
  - **Recommend FUNNY = static list + 0 core + 1 add-on.** The static FUNNY list alone removes 27 operators.
  - Nc/Na for NORMAL/HARD are [ASSUMED].
- **Other bonds:** a disabled bond can still be activated through members that also carry a non-disabled bond, and through 变形同构体 items. The briefing marks such bonds with "部分盟约所含干员阵容不完整".
- **UI:** the briefing shows a core row and an add-on row (lit = complete, grey + badge = incomplete) plus a "本局禁用干员" portrait list. The in-match info dropdown shows per-bond banned counts.
- **DIY/support picks** may be affected ("禁用盟约有可能影响自选的支援干员"). In the remake, a DIY pick whose derived bond is in D is still allowed [ASSUMED].

### A3. Enemy HP/ATK multipliers by mode and round (replaces §1 table and the §12 mapping)

Source: PRTS `卫戍协议：盟约_下半` §开始模拟. PRTS flags it as user-provided, but it is the only per-round data available.

Formula: `atkMul = base × 1.1^k`, `hpMul = base × 1.2^k × extra`, using the same `k` for ATK and HP except where noted. DEF and RES are unchanged.

Each `k` is one stack of the data effect 攻坚装备 (ATK +10 %, HP +20 %, multiplicative). `base` 0.8 = 攻坚装备II. `base` 0.7 = 攻坚装备III: data says ATK ×0.7 / HP ×0.75, PRTS shows 0.7 for both. Use the data values. `extra` 1.08 = 补给线. **终极 (ABYSS): enemy move speed ×1.15 from round 3** (急行军). **Leader HP pools are excluded.**

| Mode | base | k for rounds 1…14 | hidden (R15) |
|---|---|---|---|
| solo 标准 FUNNY (9 rounds) | 0.7 | 0 ×9 | – |
| solo 险境 NORMAL | 0.7 | 0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5,5 | 5 [ASSUMED = R14] |
| solo 绝境 HARD | 0.8 | 0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4 | 4 |
| solo 终极 ABYSS | 1.0 | 1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,6,7 | 7 |
| multi 标准 FUNNY | 0.8 | 0 ×11, then 1,1,1 | – |
| multi 险境 NORMAL | 0.8 | 0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,7,7 | 7 [ASSUMED = R14] |
| multi 绝境 HARD | 1.0 | 1,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,5,6,6,7,8 | 8 |
| multi 终极 ABYSS, **ATK** | 1.0 | 1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,8 | 8 |
| multi 终极 ABYSS, **HP** | 1.0 | 1,2,2,3,4,4\*,7,8,8,8,9,10,10\*,10\* (\* = ×1.08) | 10\* |

### A4. 机变 (special draft) details

- **Timing:** it opens at the start of that round's prep, after income.
- **Multi:**
  - One **family** per SP round and 6 shared cards.
  - Pick order is random, not seat order (screenshots show out-of-seat order). Everyone takes exactly 1 card.
  - Timers: 30 s for the first picker, 16 s for the others. On timeout a random remaining card is auto-assigned.
- **Solo:** 3 cards, pick 1, no timer.
- **Family per SP round.** What is documented:
  - FUNNY never has bounties.
  - HARD+ R3 and R9 are bounties; R11 has no 战术决策 (PRTS/Bahamut).
  - Solo NORMAL: R6 = 道具补给, R9 = 战术决策 (PRTS note "5道具补给8战术决策").
  - Bahamut: 悬赏 is common, 战术决策 rare.

  Recommended defaults [ASSUMED where not listed above]:

  | Mode | SP rounds | Family |
  |---|---|---|
  | multi/solo HARD, ABYSS | 3, 9, 11 | R3 悬赏 (`enemy_initial_*`), R9 悬赏 (`bounty_hunter_*`/`bossInitial_*`), R11 道具补给 50 % / 机密商店 50 % |
  | multi NORMAL | 3, 6, 9 | weighted: 悬赏 50, 道具补给 25, 机密商店 10, 战术决策 15 |
  | solo NORMAL | 6, 9 | R6 道具补给, R9 战术决策 |
  | multi FUNNY | 3, 9 | 道具补给 45, 战术决策 35, 机密商店 20 |
- **Card contents, observed:**
  - 机密商店: 6 random equipment of **any tier I–VI**, duplicates allowed (screenshot: VI, III, V, I, V, I).
  - 道具补给: 6 random equipment. At R3 the observed tiers were II–IV, with a duplicate.
  - 悬赏: 6 bounty effects (coins 6/2/1/2/3/1).
  - 战术决策: a mix of `allybuff_select_*` (盟誓/列装/财富/补给…), `enemydebuff_select_*`, and the current stage's `terrain_*`.
  - [ASSUMED] 道具补给 tier windows: R3 I–IV, R6 II–V, R9 III–VI, R11 IV–VI. Solo draws 3 cards from the same pools.

### A5. Other resolved items
- The **华法琳** granted-trait cap should be **12 / 24 per battle**. The official 3/27 notice changed it and PRTS lists 7/14 → 12/24. The client data still shows 7/14, even though the other 3/27 changes (奇迹 18 %, 远见 80/150, 商业包装方案 8/7) are already in it. See 02.
- ~~The skill auto-cast rows with `skillIndex` 0 mean skill 1 only (BWIKI "重装职业干员 技能1，受到伤害后自动释放").~~ Superseded by user playtest #6 (DESIGN §20): the class rows apply to **every MANUAL skill** of the class and never to an AUTO skill (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 names whole classes; the 阵法术师 row must cover 薄绿's default S2, a phalanx that never attacks with its skill off); a MANUAL skill with its own 技能范围 (not an attack-range change) uses SKILL_RANGE; automatic operations have a 3 s cooldown. See 03 C1.
- Asset URLs: 40 random URLs from `07-assets.json` were re-checked on 2026-09-27; 40/40 returned `200`.
