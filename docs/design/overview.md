# DESIGN §0, §1, §2, §11, §12 — Scope, stack, repository layout, quality bar

Part of [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) (the index; section numbers are global).

## 0. Product scope (v1)

A faithful, polished, **online co-op** browser remake of Arknights' seasonal auto-chess TD mode 「卫戍协议：盟约」(下半, `act2autochess`).

In scope:
- Title → lobby (nickname, create room / join by 4-letter code or `?room=CODE` link, host picks difficulty, up to 4 players, **AI teammates** can fill seats, ready/start). Solo (独立模拟) and co-op (同盟模拟, 1–4 humans + optional AI).
- Difficulties: 标准 FUNNY, 险境 NORMAL, 绝境 HARD, 终极 ABYSS (solo and multi variants from `modeDataDict`). Training/tutorial mode is out of scope.
- Pre-game: INFO_CHECK briefing (disabled bonds, banned operators, enemy factions, stage) → BAND_CHECK strategy draft (40 bands, random order, 1 skip in co-op) → BATTLE_CHECK.
- Rounds 1–14 (+ hidden 15): prep (shop, hand, board, items, freeze, refresh, level-up, sell, merge + reward pick, ready), 机变 draft rounds, simultaneous auto-combat on each player's own field, 联防 unite phase, LP loss/elimination, Final Assault boss round with merged LP and shared boss HP pool, Hidden Core, settlement with titles.
- Full content: 112 visible chess (+ elites), their default skills and talents, 23 bonds with layers, all 43 特质 (garrison) effect keys, 56 equipment + Arts, 40 bands, 机变 cards, enemy factions/special enemies, 10 bosses, stage devices/terrain (crates, blowers, mire, smog, deep sea, infection).
- Rendering with the real Spine battle chibis (PixiJS 7 + pixi-spine 4), procedural tiles, VFX, damage numbers, real BGM/SFX, emotes, broadcast ticker.
- Reconnect, AI take-over of disconnected players, robust validation of every client intent.

Out of scope v1: matchmaking queue, training/tutorial, DIY (甄选) slots (the 4 DIY chess are removed from the shared pool — 0.2.0 plays them as 自选编队: the picks of the 干员调配 overlay's 自选编队 tab, each sold only in its player's shop; DATA.md §18, shared/diy.js, server/match/player/diy.js), trophies/progression persistence, reporting.

## 1. Tech stack

- **Node.js ≥ 22** (CI: 22 and 24), ESM (`"type": "module"`), single dependency `ws@8`. No bundler, no TypeScript. JSDoc types where helpful.
- **Server-authoritative simulation.** Clients send *intents*; the server validates, mutates state and pushes state/snapshots.
- **Client:** static files, native ES modules. Vendored libs in `public/vendor/`: `pixi.min.js` (PixiJS **7.4.2** UMD, global `PIXI`), `pixi-spine.js` (**4.0.6** UMD, `PIXI.spine`), `preact.module.js` + `hooks.module.js` + `htm.module.js` (Preact 10 + htm, no build step). No CDN at runtime (LAN play must work offline).
- **Shared code** in `shared/` is imported by both server and browser (pure ESM, no Node APIs).
- Tests: `node --test` (`test/**/*.test.js`). Browser E2E: `puppeteer-core` driving the system Chrome (dev dependency, optional; puppeteer-core 25 is ESM-only and needs Node ≥ 22.12, so the suites load it with `await import`).

Run: `npm install && npm run assets && npm start` → `http://localhost:3000`. Friends on LAN use `http://<host-ip>:3000`. Internet play: a tunnel (e.g. `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`) or any Node host (Dockerfile provided).

## 11. Quality bar & testing

- **No crash paths**: every server handler guarded; a thrown error inside a Battle tick for one field must not kill the match (log, force-end that battle as timeout, continue). Invariants asserted in tests: no NaN/Infinity in any unit field; hp ∈ [0, maxHp]; positions inside rect; battles terminate within `timeLimit + 1 s` (boss: terminate by pool/force); pool copy counts never negative and never exceed caps; funds never negative; hand/temp sizes respected.
- Unit tests per module; content tests per effect; **full-match bot tests**: 1/2/4-player matches of every difficulty with fixed seeds run to RESULT headlessly (fast-forward: no real-time pacing) with zero errors; protocol fuzz (random/invalid intents) never crashes and never corrupts state.
- **Browser E2E** (puppeteer-core + system Chrome): open 2 tabs, create/join room, add AI, play through prep/combat of several rounds, zero console errors, screenshots saved to `test/e2e/out/` for visual review.
- Performance: a normal battle tick with 60 enemies + 10 ops < 0.5 ms; 4 parallel fields at 2× real time < 15% CPU of one core; the heavy 2-player boss field (18 ops, ~130 enemies alive, `test/sim/robustness.test.js`) < 0.5 ms per tick on a development machine, the best of three runs of the same battle — 1.0 ms when `process.env.CI` is set (GitHub's shared windows runners measured 0.51–0.58 ms and failed the 0.5 ms bar on PR #10, #12, #14 and master's own push; a real regression still shows locally).

---

## 12. Implementation phases

1. **Foundation**: build-data, fetch-assets/vendor, server platform (http/ws/lobby), client shell (screens up to room).
2. **Core**: sim engine + harness; match/meta; render engine; game UI.
3. **Content**: kits, bonds, garrisons, items, bands, enemies/bosses/devices, choices.
4. **Integration & QA**: wire everything, bots, E2E, balance pass, bug-hunt workflows until dry, visual polish.
