// server/match/PlayerState.js — authoritative per-player state + every prep intent handler (DESIGN §6.2).
//
// Handlers validate → mutate → recompute bonds → mark the private view dirty. They never throw on bad input; they
// return `{ ok: true }` or `{ error: ERR.*, detail? }`. Rules (research 00-INDEX §3–§4, 01 A1, 04 §2):
//   * Hand (整备区) 10 slots filled right→left, temp (临时整备区) 5 slots. A full hand refuses buys / withdrawals,
//     except a purchase that completes a merge and a withdrawal whose own summon stack frees a slot. Passive gains (merge
//     results, grants, returned equipment) overflow into temp; temp blocks Ready ("直到溢出情况排除才可开始进行作战").
//     A temp piece is resolved (chess sold back to the pool, items destroyed, summon stacks removed — they come back at
//     the next round start, grantTokensFor) at the deadline of the
//     first prep in which the player could act on it (tempDue): a piece that overflowed during a prep before Ready
//     expires at that prep's end; one that arrived after Ready, at the prep end (<休整期结束时> grants), in COMBAT /
//     SETTLE (battle-result grants, merges, returned equipment) or at the next round start / 机变 stays visible and
//     usable (move to a free hand slot, place, equip, destroy, sell) through the NEXT prep — nothing is destroyed before
//     the player saw it in a prep ("处于临时整备区的调度资源，在进入下一回合后会自动销毁").
//   * Board: own region rows 9–12 × cols 2–10, legality from the stage legend (board.js); deploy cap 8 (+effects);
//     tokens (placeable summons) don't use deploy slots. Board↔hand swaps are always allowed. In a boss round the
//     legality reads the player's half of the boss field (Match.deployFieldOf → board.js field 'bossL' / 'bossR',
//     user playtest #5 item 7); board coordinates are unchanged. A terrain change (terrain 机变 cards, content
//     overrides) or a change of the deploy field withdraws the pieces left on tiles they may no longer occupy (hand,
//     overflow temp; summons back onto their stack) — see _evictIllegal.
//   * Shop: per-level chess slots + item slot, copy-weighted rolls from the SHARED pool (pool.js); refresh 1 (free
//     refreshes first), one toggle freezes all unsold slots until the next round start (a manual refresh while frozen
//     rerolls everything and the new slots stay frozen), level-up price = base − rounds elapsed (floor 0).
//   * Merge: 3 normal copies (风丸 2) on board/hand/temp → 1 elite; equipment returns to the hand; a
//     reward offer of 3 different free chess of tier min(level+1, 6) is queued (never one operator twice — user
//     playtest #6 item 19; a short tier tops up from the tier below; pick 1, expires at prep end; an offer earned
//     after the prep — SETTLE / Final Assault effects — is kept for the next prep). Where the elite goes (PRTS
//     卫戍协议/帮助 "发送1名【精锐】状态的该干员至手牌区（若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，则发送至作战区对应位置）", user
//     playtest #6 follow-up): when a consumed copy stood on the board, onto that copy's tile with its facing (of several,
//     the one that deploys first — board.js mergeTile, [ASSUMED]); it replaces a deployed copy, so the deploy count
//     never grows, and it gets its own summon stack (grantTokensFor). Otherwise to the hand, overflow temp — also
//     outside PREP (a SETTLE merge's elite waits in temp for the next prep).
//   * Per-piece round counters (pieceRoundCount, piece.meta.round): an operator's own counts of the current round
//     (拉普兰德: the manual refreshes she witnessed — player feedback after 0.1.0); a new piece starts at 0, an elite
//     merged this round keeps the highest of its copies' [ASSUMED].
//   * Transformations (transformChess, 突变细胞 — PRTS 备注 "生效时，原干员销毁，获得一名高一阶的随机初始干员"): a destroy
//     followed by a gain. The carrier leaves wherever it stands (a board tile is freed, the deploy count drops), its
//     equipment — the cell included — returns to the hand first (overflow temp), then the new chess is gained like any
//     other (acquireChess: hand, overflow temp, the no-room rule; a merge it completes puts the elite on a consumed
//     deployed copy's tile — never the carrier's —, else in the hand). Official footage: the tile is empty at the next
//     prep and the new operator waits in the 整备区 (pointed out in PR #2).
//   * Items: equip max 2 (a 3rd replaces the equipped item the player picks — g.equip replaceUid, the oldest when
//     absent; equipped items are otherwise locked: g.destroy refuses them),
//     2 identical normal items (hand/temp/equipped) merge into the golden item in the hand, items are never sold
//     (destroy for 0). consume-on-equip items resolve through the effect registry and never take a slot.
//   * Tokens (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §战斗部署, user playtest #6): placing an owner with manually deployable summons
//     (tokens.json `placeable`: 赫默's 医疗探机 and 巫恋's 诅咒娃娃 with their S2, 凯瑟琳's 爬行号·防护单元, 海嗣 / 狼群 /
//     流形) sends one stack (deployLimit copies — 凯瑟琳 2) to the hand, placed by hand like any piece (no deploy slot);
//     withdrawing/selling/merging the owner removes its tokens (an elite that takes a merged copy's tile gets a fresh
//     stack of its own, like any deployment), moving it on the board (also when a summon dragged onto
//     it swaps it away) sends its placed summons back onto their stack ("移动干员时，其所属召唤物全部退场并重置至手牌区");
//     a summon stack removed from temp at a prep deadline comes back at the next round start (startRound tops every
//     board owner's summons up to the deploy limit, "干员所属召唤物会于下一回合返还"). In battle a skill's summon takes its
//     tile when the skill fires (sim/content/tokens.js dockSkillSummons). A summon whose text reads "只能部署在召唤者
//     攻击范围内" (tokens.json `ownerRange`: the tacticians' 狼群 / 流形 — their tactical point; player report #9 after
//     0.1.0) only goes on a tile of its owner's attack range (_legal / summonRange: the loadout's grid rotated by the
//     owner's facing); a swap with its owner is checked from the owner's new tile, and one an in-place re-orientation
//     (or a promotion) leaves outside goes back onto its stack (recompute → _liftOutOfRange) [ASSUMED: kept when still
//     inside]. A re-orientation that would leave such a summon with no stack and no free hand / temp slot is refused
//     (HAND_FULL); elsewhere (a promotion, an owner moved with no room) it leaves the board and its stack comes back at
//     the next round start (grantTokensFor) — no out-of-range placement reaches the battle.
//   * Facing (DESIGN §3, research 09 §1.2): every board piece has `dir` ∈ UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT (server/sim/dir.js), set
//     by g.move {…, dir} (absent ⇒ RIGHT) and kept across rounds. g.move onto the piece's OWN tile re-orients it in
//     place; a swap keeps the occupant's dir; a piece put on the board by an effect (a merge elite taking a consumed
//     copy's tile) keeps that tile's dir, anything else defaults to RIGHT (`pieceDir`). g.art {…, dir} rotates the
//     Art's range (画卷 1-1: its tile + the tile in front).
//   * Operator loadout (DESIGN §16): the human's checked `seat.loadout` ({ [baseChessId]: { skill, module } }, entries
//     equal to the defaults dropped) is re-checked against this match's data (shared/protocol.js checkLoadout; a
//     mismatch falls back to the defaults) and kept frozen; bots always use the defaults. Match.setLoadout may replace
//     it during INFO_CHECK only. battleInput() resolves every chess unit to `skillIndex` + `moduleId` (resolveLoadout:
//     normal chess → moduleId null, elite → uniEquipId | 'none'); m.private exposes `loadout`.
